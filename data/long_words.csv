pony sky aestheticspartan they needed developers to make a game with a banana and a clicking counter its not even a game im pretty sure steam is going to ban it soon
i bought man face banana and its not tradeble aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i rate banana bad extremely boring little clickersteam inventory economic game which seems similar in conception to most cryptocurrency systems but in microcosm as i was vaguely interested in the economic aspects of this game and by extension steams trading card system i got it and played it once before finding out it was a russian game i have since uninstalled it i made about cents in my steam wallet from playing this game and selling earned inventory items yay gameplay you click an image of a banana endlessly thats the clicker aspect of this game while hoping steam will award your inventory trading cards which you can then sell thats the steam inventory economic aspect of this game in a way economically its like a little parody of cryptocurrency schemes an economy based on nothing but pure faith and speculation and people doing ultimately meaningless work to unlock worthless things which they can then sell to speculators thus temporarily generating money from nothing but otherwise wasted time and effort nothing is created or produced save unlocked meaningless representations steam inventory items of various rarities the degree of rarity helping to determine their relative monetary values according to speculators who may buy these items in the hope of selling them for higher prices before the market ultimately and inevitably crashes while the games creators and steam itself make percentages of profit from every transaction which occurs in the meantime the house always has to have a way of winning somehow after all otherwise theres nothing in it for the house to play host to the gamesystem since the game is free playing the game can make you a little tiny bit of money from selling the steam inventory trading cards but honestly if you were to invest a lot of time and effort into this game while following the rules any actual minimum wage job and most sidehustles would pay astronomically better and earn you far greater social respect and opportunities than playing this game ever will and lets face it working at almost any minimum wage job is more fun than playing this awful game to play the game you must say that you agree to some fine print which says that you agree not to play the game while using any kind of additional software to cheat at the game such as automatic clicking software or ai or bots which play the game for you but ive read online that people are doing this anyway with numerous duplicate steam accounts simultaneously because there is no actual enforcement occurring at any point in this games economic chain at least not yet as a little economic experiment banana had some degree of intellectual interest but the idea that it may ultimately be funneling money however small that amount may be to fascistimperialist russians is utterly revolting and i will not take any further part in bananas little economy like russias actual economy with little to adequately support it beyond speculative bubbles bananas economy will inevitably crash it is really only a matter of time
objective interpretation hardware report and total game progress banana is a clicker game the game was ran on an intel knvidia no system crashes noted and zero crashes to desktop occurred clicks were completed at k resolution and steam achievement perfection was attained overall score and steam review template is posted below the subjective interpretation subjective interpretation well theres not much here as this is some sort of economic clicker game the premise is you click on a poorly illustrated banana and you eventually get new skins for the banana that you can sell or trade i was surprised to see that this game supports k resolution but sadly this did not increase the size of the banana i really wanted a gargantuan banana in my face but i guess thats too much to ask from the game banana also fps cap really tsk tsk developers its free and you can make money off of this game for your steam wallet but the players time is worth more out in the world if the goal is to acquire capital to buy video games thats all folks graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad dont look too long at it msdos gameplay very good good its just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just dont audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad im now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer game size floppy disk old fashioned workable big will eat of your tb hard drive you will want an entire hard drive to hold it you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboardsranks isnt necessary to progress average grind level too much grind youll need a second life for grinding story no story some lore average good lovely itll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price its free worth the price if its on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

now cs ranks st in terms of the number of cheaters valve does not just ban you for using cheats but also encourages you to play with cheats cheating is not banned even by numerous reports cs is a real paradise for cheaters valve destroyed even what they had in cs go there is nothing at all in the game for which it can be praised no new content for several months no new operations more than years have passed no danger zone no team death match tons of competitivewingmanhostage maps missing from csgo and all this while valve earns hundreds of millions of dollars on caseskeys and at the same time cannot create anything good by suppressing the worst developers in the gaming industry
counterstrike used to be more than just a competitive game having been powered by the community and their own servers cs wouldnt be able to achieve what it has today that said cs is an abomination css only focus is their competitive audience but cares so little for the social communitydriven servers groups and networks that they even killed off csgo making it completely inaccessible online even for community servers which supported the best communitydesigned maps and game modes the upgrades cs made over csgo completely destroyed counterstrikes oldest perhaps greatest communitydriven servers and maps known as surf this isnt even the worst thing they broke regarding community content as the community server browser is now detached from the game itself and has remained broken or at least barely functional since the launch of cs
so many cheater anti cheat=vac zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

uuwwooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo elden ring elden ring uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo im bouttqa bustttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
playing with those constant freezesstutterlagwhatever it is takes away a lot of fun bought it recently after dlc showed up i thought they patched this silly me
review for dlc only a disappointment not because of the common reasons ive read in negative reviews of bad designed bosses or technical issues but because ive come to realize that this dlc is all about the things in souls games i devalue vs all the things in souls games i highly value for reference at this point in the game ive beaten blackgoal knight a few ghostflame dragons death rite bird ancient dragon man dancing lion rellana and a few other minormajor bosses and unlocked about of the map for example in the early souls games demons souls dark souls i thoroughly enjoyed close quarters combat exploring castles ruins nooks crannies having to work your way through a themed arealevel while fighting mobs to joyfully reach a bonfire and then continue onward to the next bonfire and eventually your reward of a final boss fight think of all the epic locations and cities in the souls games those are great to me an example in this game is castle ensis when i got there i was excited as it harkened back to the start of dark soulsdemon souls with a castle and i eagerly dove in i was shocked after just a few minutes of pushing through mobs i was at the boss door also great to me is my characters progression the finding of new weapons items spells and the constant struggle to gain some foothold in the world as i level up getting pt in a certain attribute to get to that breakpoint where it allowed me to equip something felt great in the dlc both things above feel extremely minimalized riding around in your horse is paramount the space is vast having to work through mobs to get through a level isnt really there compared to the other souls series sure there are parts but just some parts you can ride into a town and just blow through it if you choose world bosses are a neat idea but just copy pasted dragons and huge fire ball throwing guys are just thatcopypasted same with the dungeons you find that are copypastes character progression also feels trivialized theres nothing to aspire to when it comes to that next epic stat breakpoint or a weapongear you need to equip to make your build work you are in every item and stats are just to the point of getting more is better the goal instead is to collect scadutree fragments bosses need to be over tuned to compensate and everything in the game feels more like an arms race with maxed out stats across the board for everything and everyone including you theres no nuance no decisions on advantagesdisadvantages every boss has every thing fast strong defense offense aoe etc and most people by this point in the dlc also can have high str and dex and int and fai and arc so no spell or ashe of war or summons or most anything feels like an interesting or significant upgrade to be excited aboutto me that is evident in the lazy design of the scadutree fragments just collect these and you get overall buffed up really thats lame and really uninteresting and hard for me to even seefeelquantify when im playing so it really diminishes the joy of levelling oh boy a fragment im stronger and more durable now look i can tell because that hit took only damage off me not the dlc is clearly designed as content for people who enjoy git gud and the dlc aims to come at the player hard in boss fights thats cool ive beaten every souls game from fromsoft and every other souls game from other developers and enjoy the genre a lot however this game feels beautiful but empty both literally in its world riding around with little to no secrets or any interesting pois or mobs i need to work through and its overall boring world design of just lots of cliffs to its empty feeling of copy paste bosses and lackluster zones that i do need to work through like the zone for the fissure depths laser beam rocks and just boring boring boring in addition to its overall lack of character depth and progression to the point of simply collecting rocks to git better sadly the true disappointment is after enjoying the struggle in elden ring base game and other fromsoft titles in the souls genre i simply dont enjoy the different type of struggle in this game which is the struggle to stay interested i probably would have felt less disappointment if i bought this on a + discount so thats my recco for those wondering if worth the investment if on a budget if you enjoy the open world horse combat world bosses and extreme boss fights and just all around are a fan of every aspect of elden ring and want more of it its worth full price if you liked elden ring but harken back to demonsoulsdarksouls as your favorites in the fromsoft universe and enjoy the journey of developing your character the feel of early elden ring and other souls games more its a discount purchase only or not at all in conclusion the dlc is not bad mostly there is a lot offered its a challenge it can be beautiful and it continues the elden ring adventure it does have a distinct approach that definitely funnels more towards horseopen worldarms racing than progression as a design choice which is fine where it is somewhat objectively bad is in the lazy scadutreerevered ashe fragments to make you git gud as a global bandaid and some of the technical issues foks are having with framerate where it left me wanting is in connecting me back to what i personally enjoyed most in previous fromsoft titles which is interesting level design themed progression based areas and an excitement in advancing my character in different and meaningful ways to meet challenges
im glad other people are enjoying this game and the dlc its not for me i did the mashmyfaceintotheboss thing figured i was underleveled and explored everywhere i could i went back to the boss and eventually won but i didnt feel good about it annoyed actually dodging the one or two hits that could send me back to the walk of shame doesnt feel good to me when life limits my time to learn the cues playing it like an rpg doesnt feel good to me when i still have to face the boss anyway and there isnt a major change in power dynamic between us exploring doesnt feel good to me when im out of world to explore and hit the point of minimum returns while farming i might watch other people stream just to be a part of their joy but this isnt for me anymore
elden ring is a perverse game for perverse people perverse comes from latin pervertere to turn back dark souls was an amazing game because it was different the mechanics of the game served immersion and the theme of the game the themes of the game include despair futility anxiety hopelessness etc you get the picture the world is dying and full of dead people trying to avoid their fate of turning hollow the game was so original and immersive that people loved it but there was a misunderstanding it became a meme and the salespitch was that the game is hard but being hard was not the point the point was the experience of which being hard was a part of the experience is so impact that people want to relive dark souls but you cant relive it you already had the experience and you can try to cling on to it as i tried and countless people try so when fromsoft came out with a more refined pretty openworld dark souls people were hypnotized by the promise everyone wants to love it so they will the game to be good but they dont notice that their want for the game to be good is the only thing that makes the game good elden ring is trying to be dark souls ds was hard so elden ring is more hard ds had a lot of bosses so er has more bosses ds had obtuse quests so er has even more obtuse quests but when a game is trying to be a previous version of itself but better it fails to be itself because it is trying to dark souls was creative and took risks but trying to simulate ds is not creative or risky its safe and predictable dark souls was already trying too hard to be ds elden ring has the mechanics of dark souls with a few small additions but ds was already pushing the limited mechanics with just making the bosses have longer combos and more awkward timings so elden ring is hard by giving bosses even longer combos with more awkward timings there is nothing new in the gameplay or game design of the enemies and bosses have existed in some form in a previous game you deal with every boss the same way you dodge times and hit the boss times repeat it is the same gameplay loop as every souls game but doing the same thing for years gets stale people know that the combat is stale but they are hypnotized by the illusion of a magnificent game the new dark souls people want to cling on to the past so they lie to themselves that they are having a good time but the only fun in the game is working for some goal you want the next weapon you want to see the next boss but when you have discovered most of the game you might notice that you are just doing the same repetitive tasks fighting the same repetitive bosses you have some hope that there comes some moment that validates the whole experience but it never comes the real challenge of elden ring is to see past the illusion notice that you cannot reexperience dark souls and abandon trying to then stop playing orient yourself to the future and not the past go to the unknown and do something new instead of clinging on to year old mechanics to fight bosses over and over again doing the same thing its just so futile creativity is doing something new going into the unkown future taking risks elden ring is clinging on to the past making players cling to the past just to sell you the same thing its just so frustrating and futile
despite this being a negative review this is to highlight the more longterm problems with the dlc and some others that the game has possessed for a while the dlc is very good and more worth it than most modern games even after bumped down to the same price range but there are four problems in specific one of which is sote specific scadutree blessings on paper its an interesting idea to reiterate what they are they are items that you need to level up for the dlcs specific frame of leveling these can boost your numbers quite substantially moreso than basic equipment upgrades or even levels can sekiro had something like it and it was generally enjoyed or not cared about there but sekiro is a comparatively linear more mechanicallyminimalist game than elden ring is being more along the lines of a character action game than a widely openended rpg here there are so many of them and so many blessings people will say this incentivizes exploration but elden ring already did that either by having a variety of items to find oftentimes said items were of the questkey variety or going in whichever direction you want to gain levels both of these things are a strength of the base game especially as the former are generally in rare and more obviouslylocated supply moreover npc questlines often dictated if there would even be something in a corner of the game world while scadutree fragments are generally found at golden crosses many others are dropped by somewhat unassuminglydesigned enemies that are often placed into basic foliage and enemyfilled fields which they may blend into many people consider several of the bosses in this even with scadutree blessings to rank among the hardest in the developers catalog this raises two questions if bosses are going to be that hard anyways then whats really the point of having this new power system besides stalling the early game secondly now its not i have to go level up or keep trying a boss until i get better at it its i have to now go scrape the corners of the game world possibly so i can even stand a chance in the basegame you had choice of what you wanted to farm for levels here you may have to pull up a googled checklist if youre not agonizingly thorough this effectively will hamper replay value as it will no longer be just explore on replays it will be do the checklist ontop of the existing checklist baked into the games core the basegame could effectively be mostly ignored and that was one of its strengths all in all scadutree fragments remind me of the mmostyle borrowed power system anyone who knows that is groaning reading this borrowed power was a system where at the end of each expansion you lost the power you had last expansion that you only gained through tremendous grinding moreover on altcharacters it made you have to redo the whole grinding experience again just to do the content your other characters can do in some cases you even sort of lost it with each patch in effect it made the levels and gear you did have seem like they didnt really matter most mmos have removed this system by now or streamlined it or still have it as sticking points to great expansions now why is this in the expansion to make sure that its hard levels after a certain point effectively stop mattering and most players would be around that point anyways it would already be very hard if you set the difficulty for that level range moreover the game has bakedin ways to make it hard like ng+ not using summons or special debuff rings or just not levelling or going effectively naked scadutree blessings are unnecessary that in the longterm are a chore and other mediums of this scope which were built for these systems have proven these systems redundancy boss design some of these bosses like rellana are astounding but were quickly reaching a point where the developer cant do really anything else to keep making encounters harder people already have griped about bosses doing their flips and acrobatics and hit rushattack chains but i dont think anyones yet elaborated on why this is so much of a problem bloodborne and sekiro gave you the speed to constantly trade with the boss or builtin tools to effectively stop almost any boss in their tracks here it still plays like dark souls and you even have a load of super cool weapons and spells with really elaborate combos but you effectively cant use them either the bosses never stop moving or you cant stagger anything worth enough to get more than one hit in without the mechanics of poise and a defense value on gear that matters heavy builds are subject to just backpedal until you hit them once super light weapons like daggers seem effectively pointless compared to a straight sword outside of the sparse few times you may land a crit for which there are already rings to better facilitate as a bow user myself the only real effective way to use a bow in a boss normal not greatbow is to just spam rain of arrows or just keep jumping backwards while shooting bloodborne gave bosses like the cleric beast weak spots you could shoot or throw grenades at and this would cripple the boss in some way also allowing for an easy crit that doesnt really exist here and even if it did bosses move around too much to make the shot feasible or worthwhile all the hard bosses effectively play the same in this regard they rarely stand out anymore it feels like fromsoftware has played all its hands if it keeps wanting to go in this direction and if theyre adamant about not adding the convenience the other games provided we all by now probably know about the popularity boost kai cenat gave this game the strategies he often used just spamming one weapon art on a good weapon every fifteen or twenty seconds are far too commonplace and far too necessary patches i dont mean the npc hes a real one no i mean how fromsoftware games have started to treat their patches like destiny patches prime example in this dlc hoarfrost stomp used to be super good is still very good but one of the new stompbased attacks effectively is just what hoarfrost stomp was prenerf why would they even bother then at least destiny has a liveservice element to it and even still thats still scummy there moreover weapon values like again lighter weapons have had their poise damage value on enemies reduced some of the lighter enemies then effectively have movement frames that effectively nullify the value of these lighter weapons being able to hit and shut down enemies that move a lot compared to something akin to a straight sword thisliveservicelike balancing is confusing more than anything else nerfing things just because youll add something better in a dlc or patch is effectively just planned obsolescence the multiplayer component of this game is not that big of a focus despite what the community will say so thats not much of an excuse either buildcrafting is what makes replays of these games invasions the system is breaking being able to only really invade groups means you have no reason to face them headon ds had the invader sunbros why is this not back alternatively a system to queue into an invasion lobby with others or hell just let a solo invader use a summon instead outside of communityimposed dueling arenas invasions are just both parties standing there until one side gets bored enough to leave the invader commits kms or the invader needs cheese strats with the invader continuously running something like a battle royale timed death wall is needed to force both parties to come together to just fight each other and stop wasting each others time or at least something like giant tree seeds from

you blockroll a string of attacks with the bosses flailing and jumping and flipping and breaking your target lock you see theyve probably finished their string and try to get in one r but little did you know there was an unreactable delayed aoe explosion at the end of the string to punish your attempt to get the tiniest bit of damage or maybe they fling their sword up in the air for twelve seconds and catch you rolling with some absurd clearlydesignedtofuckwithyou delay which boss did i just describe most of them the only advancement to your moveset in this game from souls is the ability to jump and almost no enemies use that as a mechanic every weapon art that isnt bloodhound step or raptor is virtually useless against the bosses torrent isnt available for bosses often enough and is often straight up worse than being on foot you dont get to do anything cool the boss just does all the cool shit to you these bosses would be way more fun in a game that expands what your character is capable of like sekiro nioh or monhun ive beaten the game four times and just finished the dlc im not bad at the game theyve just cranked up boss health bars and damage and movesets to an absurd degree and left the player character with the same roll block and attack theyve been using since demons souls now that im done with the dlc ill probably never boot up and replay this game ever again which is a shame i want to love this game its just too much of a fucking slog to ever do again
rellana needs to get on her knees and suck on my great sword she is the worst boss fight i have ever seenmmnawbndadad
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah ryt
this review might be viewed as a joke to many people which includes me that this highly positive competitive game is very individual team oriented motivates new low skilled players and most of all increases life expectancy due to overly effective psychologicalstress reducing properties
rating dota the only game where youll experience all the stages of grief within a single match denial did that guy really just pick techies anger why did you feed again bargaining okay if we win this team fight i promise ill stop playing for today depression were minutes in and we havent even taken one tower and finally acceptance gg guys we tried its a magical place where friendships are tested sleep schedules are destroyed and every game feels like a phd in anger management ive learned more about teamwork strategy and how to silently scream in frustration than in any corporate teambuilding exercise but for every soulcrushing defeat theres that one glorious victory that makes it all worth it when the stars align and your teammates actually listen to pings and your carry doesnt decide to jungle until minutes in in short if you love stress yelling at strangers and theoccasionaleup
a new players perspective i understand why people have an abusive relationship with dota and mobas in general you get the god game that is genuinely the most fun youve had in time frame with the most anus clenching nipple squeezing lip smackingly close game imaginable and secure the most insane win to your tiny new player mind that fries your brain with signals of dopamine that will never be matched in your laterdownthelineish + hours of gameplay you tell yourself you can reach that high one more time but it never comes anyways dota is pretty fun would recommend

meepooooooooooooo
too many toxic playerunbalanced match
i wasted almost years of my life completely addicted to dota everyday i woke up did drugs and played countless games until i fell asleep completely wasted my years of being a complete loser playing this game if you are new and curious about this dont even try go outside and enjoy your life even though i am and about to complete my undergraduate degree my biggest regret ever is wasting entire years playing this game awesome skill ladder in it incredibly unfriendly too new players and a waste of your fucking life go play another game and maintain a socialacademicsports life
this game will make you loose your mindrelationshipsfamily time and free time in your day i better recommend you guys do not play this fucking game and rather go some fun activities outside of your house because this game is so fucking hard and its like your mind is telling you to play this game everyday every night
game is full of bugs and incompleteplaceholder texts for instance once i died and was not revived resulting that i looked at what other players do for minutes while my character was standing in the base in black color happens quite a few times main menu too complicated it is always a search takes forever to find the most basic things i already lose my patience there maybe i am too stupid assuming that dota would be a game for a few quick rounds not really fun community is quite toxic discussing political nonsense regularly resulting in some kind of flame war and obscenities

opaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
used to be a good game back when it released and into eventually it started pandering to the typical fortnite battlepass type player went fp while doubling down on microtransaction bs the performance somehow got worse and was infested with cheaters its seriously sad to see what this game has become what the hell happened
unplayable in south america very few players bots barely any fpp matches and no solo fpp mode microtransaction hell full of silly skins and outfits that ruin the vibe of the game lame collaborations mostly kpop bands most inventory items skins outfits etc that used to be marketable on steam can no longer be sold or traded optimization is awful a pc that can comfortably run god of war cyberpunk and metro exodus on high settings struggles to run pubg on its lowest at p maybe the planned transition to unreal engine and mods can save the game otherwise dont bother unless youre in europe or asia north america is in a sorry state too pubg used to be the battle royale game i had hundreds of hours across platforms and accounts now in it is merely a shadow of its former self the soulless husk of a fallen titan that refuses to die despite being halfrotten already
bro so many incompatibilities happening like the frequent crashing and always wanting to verify files even though everything has been verified minutes ago

sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many bug
i writing this on th of june and i just want to say to pubg developers that they are an atrocious idiots for making a fing gb update when they know how steam downloading is bad for hard disk users i hope that all of your computer burn in an unextinguishable fire
i bought this back in when it first came out i have as of this writing hours into iti havent played since or so and when i jumped back in i have to go through training scenarios as if ive never played before okay whatever its a minor minute inconvenience however with hours under my belt in this game i cant play ranked and am forced to play in bot lobbies in my second round back after years and after getting my ass handed to me since i got a chicken dinner my second to last kill jumped outside a window firing into the wall and the final kill laid down in front of me and didnt even fire the weapon wow thats good gameplay i dont know whats going on with this game or how they match players but its a slap in the face to give a guy with hours into the game nothing but bot lobbies as if im a year old coming out of cod for the first time frankly its a slap in the face to give any player new or old lobbies with bots this isnt the challenging game they released in where you could easily jump in and play against other people and be challenged to get better its now an overlycomplicated interface meant to get you to spend money on skins and a joke of a game that seems to be riddled with easy bots instead of actual players killing bots isnt fun killing bots isnt satisfying id rather be killed by bad players than get easy bot kills wondering if i killed a bot or a player isnt something im interested in im wildly disappointed in how they seemed to have ruined such a good game i have a lot of good memories from this game but i cant imagine making any more in the future
e disgustoso se vogliamo lasciar perdere la grafica primi anni sopratutto se vuoi giocare con qualche fps in piu che servono piu delloro in giochi come questo ci sono altri problemi molto piu grossi le lobby hanno sono tipi di player i cheater i proplayer i ratti che aspettano tutta la partita dietro un angolo che qualcuno passi senza fare un passo con i primi non puoi nemmeno provare a giocare in quanto chi scripta usa cheat sui giochi e imbattibile senza se e senza ma con i secondi e come provare a giocare a calcio v contro messi con gli ultimi e ancora piu frustrante perche nonostante siano nettamente piu scarsi comunque ti uccideranno senza problemi perche non li vedi e non li senti fino a quando sei gia morto la maggior parte delle kill che otterrete saranno su finti player bot che vanno in giro per la mappa pur settando il gioco al meglio con piu fps una connessione in fibra un mousetappetinotastiera molto buoni esperienza negli fps come csgo e simili dove il rinculo conta sens del mouse + sens in game simile ai pro del gioco stesso esercizi di spray control + dm e prove varie circa ore vedrete che comunque faticherete a tenere la mira come vorreste mentre dallaltra parte troverete sempre persone anche di livelli bassi che controllano in modo p e r f e t t o il rinculo dellarma senza problemi dove entreranno i primi colpi su testacollo si anche meglio di come vedete fare ai giocatori professionisti nelle varie competizioni o nelle loro stesse stream ingiocabile inproponibile intankabile vedere da streamer della fluidita dei movimenti assurda anche solo il movimento destrasinistra viene fatto in modo velocissimo copiando le loro impostazioni riprovando a fare le stesse cose non verra mai allo stesso modo perche legalmente non e fattibile senza aiuti esterni situazione disgustosa la pazienza e stata tanta come le prove fatte per migliorare mira impostazioni assegnazione tasti allenamenti etc etc disistallato non consiglio a nessuno di giocare al gioco non ne vale la pena nemmeno spendendo ore e ore nel migliorare comunque le lobby si presenteranno come descritte sopra piuttosto che provare questo gioco e spendere tempo a migliorarsi consiglio vivamente di provare qualsiasi altra cosa
