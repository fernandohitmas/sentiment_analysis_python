my name is walter hartwell white i live at negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is,Banana

hi banana dev team first off id like to say how much ive been enjoying the game its a lot of fun and the community aspect really adds to the experience i have a suggestion that could potentially benefit both the game and the players consider incorporating ads into the game by doing so you could generate additional revenue and return a large portion of that ad revenue to players through ingame bananas additionally you could use some of the ad revenue to purchase bananas back from players this approach would enhance player engagement by providing more opportunities to earn bananas and create a sustainable revenue model for the game for instance players could watch a short ad to receive an extra banana or a chance at a rare item drop moreover the revenue generated from these ads could be used to buy bananas from players adding a new layer of interaction and economy within the game this way the game remains free to play while still offering a rewarding experience for the community thanks for considering this suggestion keep up the great work best regards,Banana
the best part is when you figure out how to peel the banana,Banana
this game is bananas,Banana
im to impatient for this,Banana
this is the reason economy is crap to be honest,Banana
i hate thi̇s game ı couldnt earn anything ıll play it anyway,Banana
its a big scam dont waste your time hours is already too much,Banana
this game is just a scam that wont profit you but will make the dev rich for basically no work,Banana
all bananas that cost more than are limited and do not drop the most expensive that can drop is and has a drop chance of the developers just earn thousands of people buying and selling the bananas,Banana
i hope this scam gets its own term similar ponzi schememaybe a banana rort,Banana
bs,Banana
i thought i could feed my family with those bananas,Banana
every likes on this review banana is sent back to africa,Banana
my pc shutted down automatically while i was clicking on banana i guess what that means,Banana
easy scam,Banana
cant get achievement literally unplayable,Banana
scam but you can click like once a day and get a cent,Banana
it would be a stretch to call banana a game but the description of the product is honest and youll know beforehand what youre getting the chance to click on a virtual banana to your hearts content for hours days weeks or months on end and every so often you might get a banana that you could theoretically sell but most often wont be able to since the supply of virtual bananas by far outpaces the demand in short if you dont buy any pointless bananas you wont lose anything except your time but i value my time too much to recommend this do yourself a favor and dont let your curiosity get the better of you a lesson im still trying to learn,Banana
low effort game not worth it,Banana
i hate this game,Banana
this is the most poorly made game i ever seen but not only that if you want to work for a far right socalled developer and invest in pseudo nft in the form of steam items then by all means go for it,Banana
this banana thing should be delisted as soon as possible,Banana
very sure its scam,Banana
this isnt a cookie clicker style game i thought it would be its not even a game its just some crude program that you can bot on your pc and collect skins or peels valve and the dev each get a hay penny every time you sell the item i assume gaben got bored of selling video games on steam and now has to sell pyramid schemes like some jake paul style youtuber i dont have any problems with the devs making this program though if anyone is to blame its valve for okaying programs like this its a clever idea for making money but it doesnt belong on a platform meant for actual games id rather that steam get plagued with shovelware games than nftesque programs like this because at least those shovelware games contain actual game mechanics and a little bit more effort than this in conclusion for every like this facebook post gets i will give you,Banana
wastes more money on electricity than you earn,Banana
nothing for nothing in nothing,Banana
dog water basically steam version of nfts,Banana
i hate this game,Banana
i hate when my uncle put bananas in my ass,Banana
kinda funny it exists but seriously this seems to be some sort of convoluted scam,Banana
bruh id rather install mallware,Banana
this is fun until you get to m clicks,Banana
baiting downloads for achievements and trying to scam poor country people for the items to be sellable on the steam market with bots is what i can think of as a scam game,Banana
im allergic to bananas in fact last one i ate almost killed me,Banana
after making a few clicks stop to trying maximum items dropping per day,Banana
you cant sell your items,Banana
you collect bananas and when you put them up for sale they dont sell,Banana
bob does not like this,Banana
does precisely what it says on the label unfortunately i cant recommend it as there are many other clickeridle games even free ones which do what this game does but better,Banana
you will own no bananas and be happy,Banana
game creator makes bags while you make like cents not worth even the small amount of processing power it takes,Banana
there is no vr mode this masterpiece belongs in vr i will change my review when you make vr banana,Banana
laughing out loud the fact this exists is stupid but of course you already knew that wonder how long before valve does something in response if this was the only game to do this i doubt they would but we are already seeing an uptick in indie devs learning steam inventory apis one positive though steam inventory is a cool system that has been ignored for so long it can be used for so much more than nft mining i mean item generating like this and if this dev is smart they will add some more features consuming bananas for perks exchanging crafting bananas there are options lets see if they try some out or just farm the stupid coins,Banana
thank you i can finally proceed with my plan of world domination using an army of bananafueled minions,Banana
i couldnt get past the tutorial make an easy mode or smthn,Banana
this is the worst game ever made they are scamming people in discord just a heads up,Banana
dead internet theory is starting to sound more real every day,Banana
playing banana today i learned i can afford a house day,Banana
clearly just a way for the developer to get paid for doing literally nothing by living off interest from sales for the user its a free way to get every day locked in your steam wallet whoopie otherwise the game is garbage laughing out loud,Banana
k and its not saving,Banana
you and thousands of other people will race against each other to make cent off of a jpeg that will never increase in value,Banana
useless shovelware to an outsider anything youre doing ironically just looks like something youre doing,Banana
pointless useless gamesoftware,Banana
i lost hours of my life by clicking a banana nice job,Banana
i checked and decided that this game is for poor people and they make money by selling it for laughing out loud dead inside,Banana
cant even eat the banana do not recommend,Banana
not a game but a money making scheme congrats on making owners millions of dollars for almost no invested price on their end only giving negative because i envy how greatly they milked the general stupidity awesome,Banana
clicked banana banana no move me get bored game no fun me go play with real banana instead not even good for potassium,Banana
useless and the scam game,Banana

ug developer find easy way to get shiny rocks with little work many caveman play game to get rare skins to trade at steam market but skins almost always worth tiny bit like shiny rocks then caveman trade skins developer get shiny rock steam get shiny rock caveman get shiny rock caveman do all work get almost nothing developer get shiny rock every trade game just click on banana picture not real game for example game give skin every moons skin worth shiny rocks if caveman get skins in sun that = shiny rocks minus steam and developer take shiny rocks caveman have shiny rocks left many caveman play now caveman developer make big shiny rocks every sun = shiny rocks developer get rich easy not fair to caveman numbers not exact but truth same,Banana
i got near mil banana and only drops that you can send and get only this is for nothing if you dont upgrade this than i would no one recomand this,Banana
common and rare bananas are on same price i played it few days and all i got is inventory full of crap and the legendary bananas they should be called mythical that´s how rare they must be i have the game for days and i haven´t seen one,Banana
its basically your average cryptonft fomo bullshit scam but with no crypto shit festering ground for bots,Banana
i clicked the banana and now im a banana im suing,Banana
you have to click like do they expect you to click for or hours,Banana
cash grab game and you cant even put the skins you get on and just a head up for you if you buy anything for this game on the market or not you just payed the dev but no less sad that its still a worse clicker game then cookie clicker one of the worst games i have played this year and i played payday,Banana
banana is technically not the stupidest game on steam because its barely even a game theres a picture of a banana that you click on and thats literally it thats the entire game except not every three hours or so you get a banana item in your steam inventory and once every day you get a rare banana item thats the true reason this game exists for the developers to make money off steam market item sales because this game is a meme and people love trading stupid meme items none of the bananas actually do anything mind you theyre useless tokens whose value is determined by artificial rarity this isnt even the first clickermarket game on steam but since its risen in popularity with the help of bots theres now half a bajillion copycats trying to make a quick buck with the same idea after all one of bananas developers has literally called the game a legal infinite money glitch valve is okay with all this because they profit from it too so uhthanks guys ill give the developer a ilittlei credit for being inventive with banana types i admittedly thought the biosnana was kinda cool it is also at the absolute least apparently not a cryptominer or malware overall though its really really stupid and an utter waste of time so dont play it unless you really want to spend minutes collecting one for the meme youre not gonna strike it rich with ebananas,Banana
we need mac accessibility,Banana
very boring dont reccomend,Banana
that hit box though too op,Banana
i play with my banana every night before bed,Banana
pretty disappointed thought it was a silly joke but its actually just nfts with extra steps,Banana
scam game if you play this you are only making the developers rich this kind of software should not be in steam,Banana
no limes not epic,Banana
i couldnt actually eat the bananas,Banana
cant imagine what would happened if ea knew that bananas are going to sell this much,Banana
this travesty of a game has multiple developers what the fuck if this crap is currently the most popular on steam then this years summer sale will have to offer the biggest discounts ever to save these lost souls save them gaben,Banana
they claim its a scam i dont agree but as a idler or videogame its a big fat no,Banana
nft scam but for stupid ass gamers,Banana
can not sex the banana,Banana
this is a scam that is harvesting your data you will never get anything rare or of any value its the same nft scam check your network logs the ccp is involved as all your data is being send through chinese servers do not install this on your system unless you are working within a vm,Banana
cant play second game like cs dota while banana is active cause launcher error fatal error failed to connect with local steam client process,Banana
funny scam,Banana
you click dont get saved,Banana
+ bot farm and nonsense game not even good awards its just money laundering,Banana
you make the devs richer while you only get per sale i cant believe people are playing this shit,Banana
so i let this game run in the background for hours and i also bought a few shop bananas for here are the results hin shorth list bplayedb hours bsteam dropsb bshopb bprofitb bdeveloper profitb list hsteam drops h list b common bananasb banana musicanana moonana moainana knightnana b raresb retronana spartanana stickerbombanana every single banana is worth sold for each banana has about million sellers who are before you in queue total worth list so this made cents in one week hours hshop bananas h list every banana costs in the shop at the time of buying every banana was worth between and but now a week later every banana is worth less than except for the spartanana which is bexceptionalb ultranana no price yet hacked banana blackholenana biosnana shinobinana disconana bultra rareb spartanana but falling list so i spent and if i sell all i would get plus whatever the ultranana will be worth in a few days if we just assume it sells back for its initial cost of then in total i still lost so if i actually put in the work and microsell all these bananas then week of playing gave me not even including the energy cost of running all day and the deterioration of the pc that comes with it on the other hand in the same week if i sold everything the developer made through me about so playing a week has lost me while the developer makes about not using the shop and selling only drops would make bme the developer and steamb each bifb you manage to sell them hconclusionh after a week of intensive playing and investing in banana clicker we can draw the following conclusions list btime investment vs financial returnb despite a substantial time investment of hours the gaming experience resulted in a financial loss of this highlights that the time spent is disproportionate to the monetary outcome bdepreciation of ingame itemsb the purchased shop bananas suffered a significant loss in value within just one week this demonstrates the volatility and financial risk associated with trading bananas bprofitability for the developerb while the player incurred a loss the game generated a profit of for the developer this underscores the disparity between player effort and developer revenue bhidden costsb the calculation does not account for additional costs such as electricity consumption and pc wear and tear which would further increase the actual financial loss bgame mechanics vs economic viabilityb the game appears designed to motivate players into longterm engagement without offering real financial benefits list in summary banana proves to be financially unprofitable for the player it raises questions about the sustainability and fairness of such game models and emphasizes the need to critically evaluate the value of ones time and resources when engaging with these types of games,Banana
nft scam game,Banana
you can eat banana and have a banana you can eat twice the same banana,Banana
this game is the embodiment of our decaying decadent society,Banana
gay game for crypto dorks,Banana
using peoples laziness for profit,Banana
just dont,Banana
dont invest any cent on that game spartanana was realesed and after buying have day trade lock so in market its possible not faster then but somehow they already added to market probably admins just get them without tradebans and sell day before to make more money so yes i not recommend broken game,Banana
theres no point in playing this game only for farming to get money i feel bad for the people who buy the bananas laughing out loud,Banana
why has gaming gone gay,Banana
this game sucks also a scam,Banana
i̇ts scam application dont play,Banana
i get the joke but theres no need to play itnot even for or,Banana
nobody will ever express how bad the idea of this game is all the positive reviews are all of the bot accounts and market trolls that make every steam inventory item for the game worth even if the banana is rare or better honestly this game should be reviewed by steam and then profile limited because there isnt nothing worth showing off for its stupid single achievement to every banana that drops from wasting your time opening the game,Banana
the game is just a scam dont play it originally i thought people were playing the game ironically since it has ways to upgrade your banana clicking and you pretty much just watch a number slowly go up but after a while figured out but pretty much after a while of tediously clicking a banana you get a banana item in your steam inventory which might be a rare banana that you can sell on the marketplace for like but that is very very rare most of the bananas are actually worth like cents and that will turn into cent since steam taking and devs taking and there is no decimal for cents and since so many people are playing this game and selling bananas on the marketplace you most likely wont get a chance to sell that banana and end up making cents the only reason why this game is so popular is the game takes up very little computer resources it is very easily automated and there are small unintelligent children wanting steam credits because their mother didnt buy them any anyway thats my understanding of the game i missed a lot of things just read the other negative reviews they will further prove my point,Banana
this filth is not worth i clicked instead of this is your fault,Banana
they claim its just a silly collector game but hours for common items and hours for a rare drop that is only really rare because of the long wait you go through to get it compared to the rest is a bit much for a silly collector game dont ya think on top of that you get limited time store only items which if you dont pay for and grab it before its gone you are forced to buy it off the market or miss adding it to your collection but in the words of the great banana devs anyone viewing this as a stock market should just leave owo,Banana
not a clicker game,Banana
scam game laughing out loud,Banana
these bananas aint worth nothin no demand for my cent banans scam,Banana
just some crappy clicker game that children who are too young to even be using steam play in hopes of getting some super rare banana so they can sell it to get free steam credits when in reality of the time youll get a banana in which you will only get because whenever you sell an item goes to steam goes to the developer of the game and will go to the person selling the item meaning with a banana will go to steam will go to the developer and will go to you and with most of the bananas being worth a common banana dropping every hours and a rare banana dropping every hours dont get your hopes up most of the rare bananas are worth only too you will be left with meager earnings while the developer getting at least with every banana sale with this so called game getting at most times close to million players is rolling in all the dough with this unity project they made in minutes so dont waste your time with this get a job if your old enough and make more money then you will ever will with this game in your lifetime and stop supporting the developer thank you minecrafttigger,Banana
i used to be super active as a steam trader back in the day here are my thoughts its technically not even a game and sets a bad precedent for games on steam as whole i will admit that ive made about usd in steam wallet funds for interacting with this thing and selling it to folks even more ignorant than me that doesnt change the fact that theres nothing of value to find here heres a super simple breakdown of whats going on here a player indicates that theyve engaged with the game the developer then designs a game under steams own guidelines that gives out a marketable steam inventory item to any active player steam users stick those items on the market and price rises or more often falls according to the whims of the speculative market steam and the game publisher get a cut from each sale and the player gets the rest resulting in the lowest possible sale price for anything usd im not sure how it is in cis countries since im american and those countries typically have trade restrictions for plenty um igeopolitical reasonsi so what happens honestly not a lot the games item market gets flooded with literally worthless nonsense and the only folks that really lose anything are those buying jpgs of bananas for presumably real money in a little while nearly every item will be worthless and those listed as having massively inflated prices typically are only there due to the equivalent of a steam artmoney laundering or pumpanddump scam as a trader this is a pretty insignificant blip on the radar and youre better off buying and selling other items like i said bananas will rapidly become worthless because the only market for valuable bananas will be those who already have them this game isnt a scam per se but it definitely seems that if steam allows it we can see similar games flooding the store much like how cheaplymade porn has taken over in recent years,Banana
yeah nah its too good to be true,Banana
way too difficult can someone upload a tutorial,Banana
no this isnt even a game its a way to make a quick buck off of steam trading cards,Banana
scam of a game,Banana
this is literally nft trading,Banana
scame game for money laundering,Banana
i can sell you my dic pics for cheaper believe me when i say they will be valuable just wait me today i learned i get famous,Banana
i paid for my electricity more than i earned from these drops,Banana
poor excuse for an idle game even as a joke literally just an excuse to bloat players steam inventory with useless items and not much else,Banana
worst game horrible multiplayer many bugs and singleplayer is boring sux graphics and animation is bad too,Banana
why i habe this game,Banana
prices on bananas too low,Banana
i dont get the point of this game you just click a banana i bought all the skins and cant even equip them this is such a waste of time,Banana
an absolute scam game not sure why people play it free money may be,Banana
not bad besides the staff in discord being room temp iq foreigners,Banana
still no k bana drop in my inventory > scam geam,Banana
is this a fucking bitcoin miner or a fucking infinite money glitch,Banana
malware alert be warned so where to start ill ignore the dev is a known racist the game is appealing for one reason money you can unlock bananas that can be worth a couple hundred on the market if you happen to get one of course most are not worth much at all so many are playing it for that but there is a deeper issue here i think the dev purposely made it this way so he can get it on everyones pcs why im guessing malware maybe a miner av programs arent finding anything so it could be a newly made malwarevirus how do i know this like a few people we seem to have issues with banana when its open some people experience screen flickering there have also been issues with the game causing people to not be able to shut down their pc normally me at first the game ran fun afterall its just picture you click on alot but after awhile i started also have screen flickering and after about minutes of clicking suddenly the mouse cursor kept slowly moving around the screen no matter where i tried to point it i also heard and endless sound of beeping like there was some weird error or something i unplugged my mouse and the cursor stopped of course but the sounds kept going and i could open anything everything kept shrinking down to the task bar i had to use my power button to force a reset i brushed it off as maybe a random bug and yet now the game being open still results in screen flickering and it gets worse as i click in my task manager barley any resources are being used which is a good thing but something is going on that is really fishy and since many are having the issue id advice people not to download this it could just be malware in waiting if you know how this stuff works it may be triggered at a certain point how else can anyone explain how a game that has a single picture can be acting weird it makes no sense and since some posts keep getting removed on the discussions should clue you in even more somethings wrong like i said ive been around a long time now this would be the best and easiest way to mess with peoples pcs have a totally free game where you can click and maybe get something to score tons of cash on steam to good to be true fun fact if your looking to get a expensive banana drop guess what you dont all the expensive bananas are either listed as no longer available in the drop pool or they are owned by the dev and his friends after some searching i found some of the devs friends and they also happen to have the bananas so yes to that end it is a scam for you to but their bananas and they profit perfect get rich quick scheme oh ive been banned from the discussions from mentioning it,Banana
banana is a game in which you just idle and wait for random drops of bananas of different monetary values to appear in your inventory it is not a game there is an element in which you can click the banana but to my knowledge clicking the banana has no effect on anything apart from making the count go up by one at the time of writing this review this has current players i have heard they are mostly bots just idling the game to sell the bananas on the market in hopes of getting a very rare one seems like this has spawned a number of clones such as cats cucumber burger egg do not recommend just seems like a waste of time if i am honest,Banana
absolute scam please dont play this game,Banana
i came here to say one thing and one thing only youre all a bunch of fucking losers,Banana
its stupid play cookie clicker instead cookie clicker has way better graphics,Banana

hrocketing its way to the second most played game on steam banana is nothing more than an unironic nft simulator being botted to death for skins its a case study in behavioral economics and a warning should valve sit idle that the platform will be flooded by more getrichquick aspiring players and devs alikeh ibananai is a lazy unity application with a banana sprite and a number that goes up is it even a game not at all you earn an achievement with your first click and there is no reward or purpose to continue further to be clear its not the first of its kind url=see its inspiration eggurl and it wont be the last at least five exist and more have store pages releasing launching shortly so what its harmless you may say and its true its not directly hurting anyone it drops crappy skins which can be sold for steam wallet so users win valve wins and the devs win and to be clear it is not an nft game there is no crypto wallet connection or blockchain utilization besides the market was built on csgo and tfs utilization of cosmetic drops but heres the thing it causes ripple effects in ways that arent immediately visible if unchecked it will damage the platform and hurt developers b it screws up the algorithmb steam is an incredibly cluttered storefront asset flips and abandoned early access games outnumber serious releases which is all the more reason we need help to find good games enter ibananai which isnt even a game beating out the likes of elden ring dota gta v apex if this represents the nd most played game on the platform its going to start recommending clickers and idlers to a wide audience that has no interest in them not to mention it steals spotlight from hidden gems and indies that have no marketing budget pushed even further down the ladder less sales result b it sets a dangerous precedentb meme marketable items have existed for a long time but this is the first time weve seen sales volumes this high and a game ranking in the top ten its making all of the developer community pay attention and signaling by its existence that valve tacitly approves of the situation galvanizing numerous clones racing to emulate this success will we see a top ten list occupied entirely by jpg printers it wont be long before the adult not safe for work community attempts it on a wider scale the race is on and how far this will go is anybodys guess b its easily abusedb imagine this scenario the developer controls the supply of marketable items by setting rarity and drop rates they could even create an intentionally limited quantity only in existence to manipulate a high price now what do you suppose happens if they were to gift themself a few of those limited items what stops them from listing these on the market to pocket the nearly full proceeds of the sale bypassing the normal fraction theyd receive from players selling it steam wallet can be liquidated off platform by spending it to buy other trusted indemand items making this a prime opportunity for money laundering let me burst a bubble for you right now you wont get rich off this with k accounts farming bananas your rare item is probably owned by thousands at the time you obtain it so dont be surprised by sales price and cent profit iifi it sells you have to wait in line behind k other people who already listed theirs days ago the oversupply is only getting worse and were seeing developers scramble to come up with creative solutions to keep this ball rolling expect to see crafting as the next hot topic mash + skins together for a shot a unique item with its own rarity roll as an attempt to cut down on the clutter but will there be buyers for these or will it be another race to the bottom as sellers undercut one another in the hopes of a payday the market is already saturated by this crap and theres no outlet for them once you buy the item it sits in your inventory forever unless you write support to delete it or the game adds a delete button or some other way to consume them the questions that nobody has answers to are is there a point the market reaches saturation when will buyers realize skins are worthless investments how many bananalikes can the community run at once before they or their pcs give out the only thing to be said with certainty is time will tell i bet valve is nervously hoping it will fizzle out fast so they can dodge another bullet quoteuachievement huntersu launch the game click once close the game ~ second to quote,Banana
steam exploit abusing desperate people praying to get easy and free money for doing nothing it is free so most people fail to see the evil and manipulation behind it in other words type of modern scam,Banana

the electric bill for keeping your pc on is way more than what you will make by getting bananas,Banana
banana on steam is an extremely basic game designed primarily for farming steam items rather than offering any substantial gameplay experience the entire premise of the game revolves around a static picture of a banana players click on this image to increment a number displayed above it and thats the extent of the interaction this simple mechanic quickly becomes repetitive and its evident that the game exists mainly to exploit steams item drop system while it might appeal to those looking to farm items with minimal effort it lacks any form of engaging content or creativity i had hoped banana would receive a more creative update to enhance its simplistic concept adding a few minigames animations or even varying levels of interaction could make the experience more enjoyable and justify its presence on the steam platform as it stands the game feels like a missed opportunity to turn a quirky idea into something more entertaining and worthwhile for now it remains a functional but uninspired clicker designed solely for item farming,Banana
scam game,Banana
i was here for this but its wrong,Banana
whoever made this needs to go straight to jail,Banana
ya pretty sure most of the people playing this are bots ironic bots play on steam alot that seems familiar and this is basically nfts without the blockchain or whatever and probably a scam cuz its likely all the best items go to the devs friends,Banana
what is there to say really the title is the game,Banana
i tryed this game to see if you really can make money and all my banana cost in hours of autoclick i get just bananas and they cost this game is like you open a case in csgo and get gold if you are really lucky you can get something good,Banana

clicker game that seems like a scam but it some kind of nft garbage,Banana
youre all fucking stupid,Banana
its just a banana and you click it for a banana that you can only sell for i played to see if you would even make much money and i was right its not worth it and i only got bananas from my play time,Banana
how did gaming get to this point its a banana picture clicker useless trash brainrot game,Banana
for the first time playing i spent almost hour to get clicks manually i asked myself why am i playing this game and can this game be called a game this game doesnt make me happy because it just clicks my mouse in this game we can use right click middle click and left click on our mouse but i only use right click and left click because it only uses two fingers but after almost hour i click my mouse manually i feel two of my fingers age faster i gave this game a not recommended review because i dont understand the purpose of this game h clicksh,Banana
you actually have no life if you genuinely think that by clicking on your screen for hours you will gain any money stop wasting time and get an actual job,Banana
this game is a botnet waiting to happen if you havent already you should remove it,Banana
im probably too old this where the world goes,Banana
the dev of this game is a trumpfan and took names like abschieben schafft wohnraum just a racist pls dont support him with selling bananas,Banana
a funny lil scam dont buy bananas and ur good,Banana
basically a get rich quick scam by the devs almost identical to nfts chances are near impossible to get the super rare bananas and when you get one its worth nothing while the devs and friends of the clowns miraculously get lucky enough to get the rare ones then sell them for a lot more money than the most common rare ones what a joke dont install,Banana
a small message to the developers i understand the number of people is large its cool but you dont have to abandon the project development is needed and there is one very simple thing that needs to be done you need to create a system for removing bananas from circulation and this should be done by the people themselves you can force them by introducing the reforging of bananas conditionally reduce common ones to of some greater rarity next to new rarity this will allow for further development without this there will definitely be no future and the project will soon die ill change the review when you enter this i dont see any other way for the project so i really hope and wait,Banana
no gameplay = no recommend,Banana
literal dogshit and scaming devs,Banana
dont believe this fake hype the only valuable coins in the steam market are there for show of previous events you cannot create banana coins like that from this game false advertising the clickcounter is just a sly unity engine install i would recommend you uninstall reinstall uninstall reinstall uninstall reinstall for every piece of shit banana you got,Banana
update this is a scam game by kids give me bananas give me bananas give me bananas give me bananas give me bananas give me bananas,Banana
capitalism is trash this game is a proof live npc on tiktok is another this kind of thing can only happen on a system where the bourgeoisie accumulate so many money that can buy something that worth nothing for a very expensive price only to promote stupidity while theres billions of people dying of starving because they dont have money to buy food,Banana

every like i put bananas in my ass,Banana
its bad and a waste of time,Banana
not a game its a get rich quick scheme where youre being scammed by the dev you spend your valuable time playing this game while the developer becomes rich,Banana
play cats its better,Banana
oh boy i sure do love this in depth gameplay and maybe i can get a million dollars if i just bkeep clickingb,Banana
what the fuck is wrong with the world,Banana
my face when theres a pyramid scheme with a clicker game,Banana
yes it is a clever scam but i got an achievement out of it,Banana
if anything should be reviewbombed and mass reported its this this isnt even a game its a quick cash grab and also full of malware devs are known scammers as well this is actually absurd and for everyone who posts a bad review you should also report this product there is a button to report product right next to the share and embed buttons you have to scroll down a bit to find them,Banana
its a game but its a png game,Banana
devs hold all of the rare bananas nothing you get will ever be worth more than cents this game is a waste of time,Banana
interesting game not even a game actually just a pyramid scheme for the devs to profit and make money it is cool that it follows the csgo approach in getting skins every so often however not so much once you realize only the profitable skins are given out to the devs,Banana
this is a banana collecting clicker game that doesnt have the core aspect of the game even implemented which is why nobody wants to buy anything like dont release the game until you can actually equip the bananas duh,Banana
dev is hella suspicious likely scammer,Banana
i cant believe that such a scam can get positive reviews,Banana
scam shit for dumb people,Banana
youll spend more energy to run this scamapp than youll receive the profit i would say its a scam as its tricking users with outcome that never will cover investments just imagine those mathematical nubs that spending time create bots it in order to receive cent humanity still ai please save us,Banana
its a scam,Banana
buy the skins if ur a rerard,Banana
this is the equivalent of sols rng on roblox but a steam game,Banana
whenever i go away from keyboard i will usually turn this on to farm bananas for pennies even though they usually wont even sell however this is not a way to make decent money as the average person will just keep getting common bananas to sell for a couple cents you may get lucky but the odds are so low that there are so many better ways to spend your time in short you can get it if you want and farm cents for fun but dont expect to get alot of money clicking bananas,Banana
youre only enriching the developers this is truly a legal moneymaking scheme for them,Banana
this game may seem like free funds but is just a waste of time you just stay and press simple enough no the probability of you getting a rare banana or even just a banana are very low and also people dont buy as frequent as excepted and i dont mean that the changes should be very high or that people should buy every banana they see but really is just a bad idea for game,Banana
its a game about clicking a png of a banana nothing special no skins no content no nothing just a png of a banana and clicking it gives you more like most average clicker games but this one gives you a small chance of an item being dropped when clicking the banana it has become nfts all over again,Banana
i dont think its a scam in the sense that it is exactly what the dev says i just think it could you know at least be a game even if the main point is to sell bananas at the market cookie clicker is at least fun for a clicker game mind you theres not even a simple click animation or anything i fail to see any effort in this that said all the reports around this are pretty entertaining at least,Banana
scamm for monkies,Banana
pretty sure it is a keylogger,Banana
another crypto scam do not play it,Banana
bro just play normal games,Banana
literally free money for the developers,Banana
waste hours of just clicking with an autoclicker not recommended only play for minute and get achievement and close it,Banana
hours drops all worth pence better get to work if you think this is gonna make you money half of drops are of worthlessness,Banana
this game is a scam,Banana
funny meme but not worth it,Banana
this game killed my dog and usurped my fathers throne,Banana
what even is this theres not a lot to do in banana you just click an image of a banana purchasing skins is not worth even the small dent in the wallet overall a disappointing and pointless experience,Banana
the game is a scam anyone that is trying to get high value drops to sell dont try played for hours and everything was worth each not saying it isnt possible just not worth it plus the dev is a racist so,Banana
its a scam fking stupid all its good for is making cent every hours and at that point why just play cs get your weekly drop and make a dollar dont leave ur pc on and up your electricity bill for cent every hours so fking stupid,Banana
yeah you get free cents but the dev gets cent per banana sale and with hundreds of thousands of sales each day the dev gets insane amounts of money while player get crumbs,Banana
reasons why i dont like this game and how it can be improved banana count doesnt save the banana count doesnt save so progress is lost between sessions no inventory system there is no inventory system in the game to manage collected items no use for banana drops there is no use for banana drops making them feel pointless no menu the game lacks a main menu for navigation and settings no upgrade system there is no upgrade system that uses the banana score for enhancements too simple the game is too simple and lacks depth no sound there is no sound making the game less engaging no potions adding potions could make the game more fun and dynamic no interactive questions adding questions or trivia could make the game more interactive lack of updates the game lacks regular updates leading to a stagnant experience regular updates with new content features and bug fixes would keep the game fresh and maintain player interest i believe that if the developer learns from this feedback and adds these features to the game it will become more popular by addressing these issues and implementing the suggested improvements the developer can significantly enhance the games appeal and popularity i believe that if the developer learns from this feedback and adds these features to the game it will become more popular among players,Banana
if youre playing for money then youll likely get like ishish cents for hours youd get more from mcdonalds,Banana
how low does a society have to go intellectually for this to not get removed from steam i am aware theres a lot of sh‍it on here but this is just a scam,Banana
i would rather work at mcdonalds and get paid more,Banana
it did not save,Banana
hnumber played game on steam h at the time of this review and its a nft game for bananas,Banana
shit scam game,Banana
this is a garbage game an autoclicker defeats the purpose of even playing this in less than minutes i already had well over clicks,Banana
cant eat the banana,Banana
pure garbage for people with literally zero braincells,Banana
wish i could get better bananas mine are rotten,Banana
you dont have to leave the game running in the background just open it every hours for minute click close thank me later,Banana
the only use this game has is making sure your pc doesnt turn off,Banana
give a man a banana and you feed him for three hours teach a man to pick bananas and you turn him into a joke,Banana
initially i thought its just a single tasty banana game until i decided to turn it on get more info just to realize its hidden pyramid scheme unbelivable how this simple innocent game revealed itself as burning rabbithole what a fing disgrace massive pain just because some maniacs wants moor shite money and so on through massive farming banana should remain pure and innocent otherwise it would be fine i wonder what creator is feeling right now,Banana
russian cliker where russians there is trouble,Banana
even the more rare bananas are only worth cent and will never sell also every time you close the game the counter resets so theres really no point in playing this this only reason this game likely exists is to launder money,Banana
couldnt sell enough bananas to pay for college,Banana
its a game where you click the banana and have a small chance for dropping a steam banana item that you can sell for cents sometimes more but mostly that most players are bots and you only get cent when selling for cents for valve for the dev and for the person selling,Banana
dont buy or sell bananas <,Banana
it filled with bots might be a front for money laundering also is basically a clone of the mediocre egg,Banana
downloaded this crap and left it open for min only to be able to leave this review too long i did not read marketplace scam go watch jauwns vid on youtube for more info also screw valvesteam for allowing this trash to happen in the first place,Banana
you cant get anything useful from this game you just get a banana and so what its useless,Banana
hm what do you think you gonna make money nope bananas dont get sold anyways,Banana
bad game,Banana
two of the best reviews for this game i found the developer of this game has devised a method to get rich with minimal effort thousands of people play this title in the hope of obtaining rare skins to resell on the steam market however in of cases players only get skins worth euros subsequently players sell those skins and this is where the developers method kicks in of the euros earned euro goes to the player euro goes to steam and euro goes to the developer consequently in the end the player earns basically nothing while the developer earns euros for every transaction made besides this in this game you do absolutely nothing except clicking on the image of a banana its easy to see that the developer is using thousands of players to make money effortlessly practical example in the game a skin is obtained every hours that skin is worth an average of euros assuming that each player gets the maximum number of skins in a day that is = and then manages to sell them by the end of the day each player would earn = euros minus the commissions for steam euros and for the developer euros wich makes a net profit of euros however if we consider the total number of players currently the developer will earn = euros per day this strategy is certainly very convenient for him but its not right to exploit users in this way note maybe the figures i wrote arent accurate but the basic point doesnt change its not a scam per se as a lot of people are saying but it is one of those nft bro attempts at making a return and majority of the people dont realize that only of the playerbase if you can even call it that would actually make any money and the rest are just wasting their time thinking they found a money making glitch as a game it offers absolutely no value and im surprised its allowed on this platform especially with valve being openly against nfts and i expect to see some change as to how the marketplace is going to work in the future especially since bots are flooding so many games now and people running bots here hoping to get the big money drops people will point out that csgo is known for gambling and that its essentially the same thing but they will forget that for some people those skins are actual collectors items despite how dumb it might seem to a lot of people and the game isnt clicking on a static banana png its an actual video game even though the community has gambling issues dont waste your time or electricity hoping you can sell a png to some chump online and dont abuse systems in place because it will eventually come back and bite the consumer just like steam library share changes due to low regional prices being mishandled by people that dont need those cheaper prices,Banana

cant wait to earn per hours,Banana
i lost my child wife parents sister pizza and house to thisd,Banana
dont ever invest your money into that but i must admit that selling dropped bananas gave me like cents,Banana

this game should be banned,Banana
lets be fair of the people playing this will never get a banana that actually sells for a decent price but im a gambler i will prob continue playing laughing out loud,Banana
being at the top of the pyramid of life makes humans appreciate the cohesive mentality of the herd in pursuit of insurmountable pleasure the human race devised a plan to incorporate two factors that resemble the abomination thats called desire money and bananas so this beautiful and majestic being of a developer decided to say fck it lets just combine the two of them the result was astounding and the herd was vastly drawn to this masterpiece for what reason for money maybe for fame maybe for wasting important and invaluable time absolutely as this developer is getting thicker and thicker with all the money hes making the herd will be left with nothing more than a bunch of futile and purposeless skins which will never be enough to make them feel the pleasure that a human would call banana,Banana
why is this piece of sht allowed on steam i thought trash greenlight games were a thing of the past,Banana
this is what peak insanity looks like,Banana

i been clicking for hours + and i did not get any rare bananas,Banana
just no theres hardly any effort in making this game all you do is just click the banana and the number count goes up better go buy a real banana and eat it much better experience,Banana
its not a scam per se as a lot of people are saying but it is one of those nft bro attempts at making a return and majority of the people dont realize that only of the playerbase if you can even call it that would actually make any money and the rest are just wasting their time thinking they found a money making glitch as a game it offers absolutely no value and im surprised its allowed on this platform especially with valve being openly against nfts and i expect to see some change as to how the marketplace is going to work in the future especially since bots are flooding so many games now and people running bots here hoping to get the big money drops people will point out that csgo is known for gambling and that its essentially the same thing but they will forget that for some people those skins are actual collectors items despite how dumb it might seem to a lot of people and the game isnt clicking on a static banana png its an actual video game even though the community has gambling issues dont waste your time or electricity hoping you can sell a png to some chump online and dont abuse systems in place because it will eventually come back and bite the consumer just like steam library share changes due to low regional prices being mishandled by people that dont need those cheaper prices,Banana
its clearly a scam the dev is a scammer,Banana
this is just plain stupid this ass crap takes minimum effort i could make this in gamemaker in minutes and this gets all these players meanwhile actual good games dont get the recognition,Banana
evil money making scheme we need to stop the dev they are evil,Banana
how to waste time earning basically nothing,Banana
another clicker game slop,Banana
this game is a test of natural selection i am so happy losers get to waste their money on bananas pngs they can do nothing with,Banana
dont buy anything from this game or its market instead sell any and all bananas you get so you dont end up holding the bag of useless items,Banana
banana is glitched cant click it ive been trying to click this garbage for hours now but it just isnt working,Banana
game is dumb dont play please stop tanking this shit economy,Banana
waste of your time the devs are horrible people most of the positive reviews are just gen zalpha bullsht,Banana
i believe this thing might have hacked my discord,Banana
very obviously a scam laughing out loud,Banana
its not worthy to join this squeme check out the quantity and sales of each banana on the market and you will notice that the chance to obtain a banana worth something else than digit cents is around ^ per hours save your eletricity bill and turn off your computer when you go to sleep and i recommend you to try any other clicker games because anything else is better original content,Banana
banana is a stark example of how games should not be designed games are meant to entertain challenge and bring people together but banana does none of these things instead it serves as a mechanism for generating revenue for the developer under the guise of gameplay its disappointing to see gaming platforms used for such exploitative purposes,Banana
i have won two bananas and steam has removed them from my inventory terrible service,Banana
forced to write a review laughing out loud,Banana
waste of time power and is an obvious scam by the creator but i can make cents off of it so why not have it on in the background,Banana
worst game ever i want my refund of like this if you too want your refund,Banana
i rate banana bad extremely boring little clickersteam inventory economic game which seems similar in conception to most cryptocurrency systems but in microcosm as i was vaguely interested in the economic aspects of this game and by extension steams trading card system i got it and played it once before finding out it was a russian game i have since uninstalled it i made about cents in my steam wallet from playing this game and selling earned inventory items yay gameplay you click an image of a banana endlessly thats the clicker aspect of this game while hoping steam will award your inventory trading cards which you can then sell thats the steam inventory economic aspect of this game in a way economically its like a little parody of cryptocurrency schemes an economy based on nothing but pure faith and speculation and people doing ultimately meaningless work to unlock worthless things which they can then sell to speculators thus temporarily generating money from nothing but otherwise wasted time and effort nothing is created or produced save unlocked meaningless representations steam inventory items of various rarities the degree of rarity helping to determine their relative monetary values according to speculators who may buy these items in the hope of selling them for higher prices before the market ultimately and inevitably crashes while the games creators and steam itself make percentages of profit from every transaction which occurs in the meantime the house always has to have a way of winning somehow after all otherwise theres nothing in it for the house to play host to the gamesystem since the game is free playing the game can make you a little tiny bit of money from selling the steam inventory trading cards but honestly if you were to invest a lot of time and effort into this game while following the rules any actual minimum wage job and most sidehustles would pay astronomically better and earn you far greater social respect and opportunities than playing this game ever will and lets face it working at almost any minimum wage job is more fun than playing this awful game to play the game you must say that you agree to some fine print which says that you agree not to play the game while using any kind of additional software to cheat at the game such as automatic clicking software or ai or bots which play the game for you but ive read online that people are doing this anyway with numerous duplicate steam accounts simultaneously because there is no actual enforcement occurring at any point in this games economic chain at least not yet as a little economic experiment banana had some degree of intellectual interest but the idea that it may ultimately be funneling money however small that amount may be to fascistimperialist russians is utterly revolting and i will not take any further part in bananas little economy like russias actual economy with little to adequately support it beyond speculative bubbles bananas economy will inevitably crash it is really only a matter of time,Banana

another clicker but here you are a crypto investor of course you will definitely get a cool banana and it will definitely be bought for a few hundred or thousand of your currency its a pity that the bananas are not nft for this negative review,Banana
you do get money but its too cheap,Banana
we must regretfully inform steam and the developers of banana that each of you are in violation of the rd law of the edicts detailed below this is your formal notification please immediately bring your business into compliance thank you administrators must make a good faith effort to destroy all bots and to ban all cheaters if a realm has a recurring subscription or cost associated with it our loving and glorious emperor norton ii has determined that such a realm shall recieve extra scrutiny under this law and penalties for voilation will be increased while if the violation remains uncorrected corrective action will also be increased in rate and severity norton ii is well aware that there are economic incentives to allow bots and cheating in some shadow realms norton is also aware that the higher you go up the chain of command the worse and the lazier the administrators get its a proven fact that administrators who live in the shadow realms love the shadow realms but administrators who love the shadow realms and decide to live there are not unfotunately those who ultimately make decisions regarding integrity this is the duty of emperor norton ii,Banana
worse version of egg,Banana
ohhhhhhhhhh banana literally only play this if you want a few extra cents,Banana
i spent minutes playing this i want those minutes of my life back,Banana
bad game,Banana
waiting for somone to spend k on my bananas so i can rate this game positive,Banana
no you are not going to become rich just stop it you will lose more money on power than you save on games,Banana
wheres the game,Banana
it is true that the developer earns cent for every cents transaction while the player selling the useless item only earns cent per transaction but thats not a getricheasy scheme however that also means that every transaction a random idiot in the world is losing cents you can easily cut the scheme by not having random idiots everyone buying bananas are complete morons go feed your nft monkeys with those idiotic bananas nobody cares and this dev will be very happy if you do so sure you can go find a bigger idiot to buy the banana from you everyone owning the banana should just get rid of it as soon as possible,Banana
you lose more in electricity,Banana
basically spam on steam basic game that achieves nothing except give you a single achievement and some kinda tradeable skin,Banana
changed dogenana skin and it looks like dogshit what the fuck absolutely trash ass game fuck you,Banana
pretty much just crypto mining to get the rare banana you need to leave this application running in the background for hours,Banana
deceptive marketing i thought this was gonna be a video game and not nft type stuff i would avoid this,Banana
as a latecomer i cant even earn a coke,Banana
game is essentially a cash grab that they are using to take advantage of people this video explains it best,Banana
you barely gain any money while the dev went from rags to riches kind of smart not going to lie but its still a scam either way,Banana
clearly a scam,Banana
this game ruined my life,Banana
i played this a couple of months ago and i had no idea theres was a whole stock market i just played it for the achievement sold a banana for cents and someone actually bought it what a moron,Banana
how to play install the game launch the game and wait for minutes minimum time required to write a review visit game store page under do you recommend this game select no and click post review uninstall the game and remove from steam library,Banana
sure you can get cents from this game but the only one who gets money is the autor who has a history of being a very shady and untrustworthy individual stop farming the bananas you arent making yourself any money you are making money for a scammer,Banana
you just click go play cookie clicker its better taste better aswell,Banana
i read in the game it doesnt give a good drop at all its all dollars if youre a bad luck person like me dont install it,Banana
what an idiot game,Banana
just dont waste your time on this,Banana
cant have sex with banana,Banana
dude its a banana clicker gamer i hate it i dont like it,Banana
ive played for and a half hours and have not received a banana i thought i was supposed to get one every hours what the fuck,Banana
what in the pyramid scheme is this bs,Banana
what type of nft st is this this isnt even a good game on steam,Banana
i dont understand how zoomers find sht like this funny,Banana
supersaturated market plagued by farming bots on thousands of fake accounts per real person non existent profit per sale not worth run it in the backround for hours played just for the meme,Banana
just dont please,Banana
silly game,Banana
this game is a scum way for the dev to make money without putting out a single good thing this should not be on steam at all and exploit the market system in steam to make tons of money its a free mlm and no one should support it,Banana
shit scam i forgot it was open,Banana
report this to steam its a game solely designed for the purpose to abuse the steam marketplace rather than providing any real gameplay or value to genuine players the developers have tried this number of times in the past but fail with each attempt due to no traction on their games and they have been banned from the steam marketplace before,Banana
its just a money laundering scheme,Banana
what is this,Banana
big boi scammer right here brothers gonna steal all yo moneyz,Banana
i hate the internet,Banana
game,Banana
until just a few minutes ago i was absolutely clueless about the transactional aspect of this game and was playing it as possibly the lamest way to kill time but after watching url=this insightful video on youtubeurl i vehemently refuse to participate in this blatant scam and ill stop to help the scammers who put it out there what a shame,Banana
why is this allowed on steam,Banana
i get nightmares about bananas now i dont know how to stop them save yourself before its too late,Banana
this game is horrible its not fun at all there is nothing interesting about the this game you click a banana that is it too the current players either you have the brain of a monkey or have never played any good games because this game is god awful i would give it a negative score if i could but for now the most fun i have had was closing the game,Banana
dont play it unless you relly like nfts,Banana
i call upon all gamers to boycott this horrifically racist transphobic title until the developers post proof that all white males have been fired enough is enough trans and people of color gamers are dying because of companies like this one until all white males are fired the devs are literally complicit in murder ive already flagged this racist piece of crap in the steam store and i encourage others to do the same comments,Banana
this game is literally made to test human stupidity,Banana

hbvery disablist gamebh only a select few of the maps found within the game feature wheelchair accessibility making it very difficult for someone like myself to manoeuvre around far too many staircases these are the main reason i die within the game aside from these enormous flaws i quite enjoy this game please valve add more disabled operators and for the love of all that is right with the world add more ramps and disabled access its if people can claim to identify as a flying green haired giraffe basing their entire personality on their sexual preference i should be able to get upstairs without assistance,Counter Strike 2

angry russians but good,Counter Strike 2
great game,Counter Strike 2
the game is not worth playing due to valves noninterest in investing into the anticheat low latency servers tick or just content in general the devs who work on this product are not quick to output content meaning it is unlikely to be severely improved unlike other games of its ilk which get dedicated content released in a decent cadence the game has cut content from the original cs go with very few of the original game modes available all the while disabling players to play the original game as it was removed to allow for cs to take its place valve makes more than enough from this game so ideally if you are reading this please actually make something worthy of the collective player bases payments to new players find a better game worthy of your time dedication and money i hope it changes but i doubt it,Counter Strike 2
csgo was very good cs is a bad gameupdate a lot of frame drops and stuff i dont recommend it better play zula or tf,Counter Strike 2
they just killed csgo for this unfinished game,Counter Strike 2
its a good game but so many cheaters fix please,Counter Strike 2
ridden with cheaters anticheat does not exist also playing from eu forces you to play the game with non english speaking folks from a country that is considered quite hostile towards other neighbouring countries,Counter Strike 2
develop a proper anticheat that actually detects cheats + doesnt false flag innocent users en masse for programs that arent cheats and while youre at it implement all the old features we had back in global offensive fix the game,Counter Strike 2
were is the f king vac,Counter Strike 2
fixcs this game is broken missing most of the maps cheaters are everywhere and we still are missing alot of the skins from csgo,Counter Strike 2
this whole game is soooooo f up compared to source or uh no custom server filtering and selection stupid big menus uh rip source rip good old cs times uninstalling,Counter Strike 2
unplayable input lag so bad and stuttering every game i play i have a very good pc with ti super and a xd and gb of ram this shouldnt be happening love this game but completely ruined now,Counter Strike 2
it was good year ago cause we were not lagpacket loss in iran but i installed with great gusto and have packet loss in dubai server only in this game,Counter Strike 2
this game has no soul the models and the environment looks too cartoonish to me the weapons have no spread at all so no matter what you have its basically a sniper rifle you dont have to buy ammo anymore or armour all is give to you the menu music is terrible what happened to this once great game,Counter Strike 2
very buggy i`m dead before enemy shows up on screen strong pc extremely fast connection please bring back csgo,Counter Strike 2
i spend too much money on cases they ruined my life but i did pull a knife still not worth it,Counter Strike 2
hey valve maybe you can start actually enforcing third party software being used by cheaters constantly in this game the lack of oversight and discipline in premiere mode against people toggling chases away legit players it is absolutely disgusting that nothings been done by a multi million dollar franchise this is why everyone is running far away from this game this coming from a veteran whos been playing counter strike for over years since the first xbox release do better we deserve legit ranked stop fixing nonsense that no one asked for start focusing on the broken matchmaking system and the cheaters hiding within it,Counter Strike 2
add more maps to the competitive game legitimately you previously mentioned that you removed old maps due to a low player base but now it seems like youre unwillinglazy to reintroduce them to the players i dont count the new ones im talking about the old maps,Counter Strike 2
absolute filled to the brim with cheaters scammers hackers valve is the worst company in the world,Counter Strike 2
utter garbage how they managed to ruin csgo is beyond comprehension griefing bans by enemies too cheaters of all kinds softwareconsole most toxic community no servers random ingame crashes,Counter Strike 2
cs contains cheaters,Counter Strike 2
dont play this game you just gonna have a bad time and cheaters and going to tilt you,Counter Strike 2
broken game enjoy undeserved griefing bans cheaters plenty,Counter Strike 2
damn this game crashes constantly i will remove it completely after this game i dont plan on playing for a long time,Counter Strike 2
you need prime to level up,Counter Strike 2
fucked up game got destroyed bu russians horrible,Counter Strike 2
if you paly this game or mare than hours you will die at,Counter Strike 2
please ban cheaters otherwise the game will die soon,Counter Strike 2
games incomplete still did a major which was only good because of playersits a shitshow dont play valorant better,Counter Strike 2
no anti cheat no server tick improvements no more legit players in leader board no more vac update no csgo no more devs effort to improve the game nor update i miss csgo i spent alot of time to play this game sadly i cant take it anymore hoping valve do some improvements note anticheat is the most decade old issue of the game and up untile now still no solution cs is just cs with rtx on but still same issue with the csgo,Counter Strike 2
you know whats fucked up getting an update for this game and instead of actually upgrading anything besides graphics you get less than you had before overwatchsystem was removed vac has gotten so incompetent that at this point its not even dangerous to hack or cheat anymore since like of cheaters wont even get banned they introduced a new ranked mm premier where most top listed guys are usually removed from the listings because of cheating and none of the guys i played against which were literally ragehacking or running around with a ssg noscoping everybody whose profiles i check from time to time have received any vac ban whatsoever but you do get weekly drops for free so i guess some things improved,Counter Strike 2
too much cheating nothing being done about it only cs maps,Counter Strike 2
game is butt nothing but bots,Counter Strike 2
i am racist towards russian speaking people,Counter Strike 2
the amount of cheaters in prime trusted mm is unbelievable my buddies and i come across multiple in one night and it ruins the vibe and then everybody gets off for a game revolving around teamwork this game really pulls us apart,Counter Strike 2
this might be one of the worst games ive ever played in my entire life,Counter Strike 2
great game but filled with hackers and no anticheat there seems no drive to actually address it,Counter Strike 2
is pure ass as bad a tf to be honest with all the bots,Counter Strike 2
i was quick selling my items then this steam wallet pending shit strikes me why should i fucking wait for my money,Counter Strike 2
valve is ruining this game update by update just bring back csgo,Counter Strike 2
what a shitshow of a game full of cheaters can not recommend the game in its current state,Counter Strike 2
very bad game,Counter Strike 2
first week i played this game the servers were stable on miss but now i do not know what happened its unstable and my ping still miss,Counter Strike 2
ruined game all achievements deleted full of bugs maps reworked to bad once fun mods unplayable now arms race unplayable because everyone spams the pool map,Counter Strike 2
leaving this as a negative review until valve starts caring about this game again,Counter Strike 2
was a good game and then the arrived and made it bad,Counter Strike 2
having a community with lots of unpleasant people in it is one thing forcing someone to win games solo after having spent + hours just so they may play with friends again which probably played of those hours with you is another thing id probably have to get a lobotomy or two to enjoy this bullshit,Counter Strike 2
probably one of the most games to have cheaters in every single match and nobody does shit about it and worse part is that votekick system is so shit it usually allows to kick person in a people match and its not the one who is cheating not sure how after so many years there was improvement apart some graphics,Counter Strike 2
trash game abandoned by devs,Counter Strike 2
old cs is the best cs you will ever play the new one sucks bring back old maps like cache cobble train,Counter Strike 2
not recommending for new comers full of cheaters trash anticheat,Counter Strike 2
an absolute joke of a game in the worst state its been in since csgos launch i love counterstrike i love the gameplay the teamwork the mechanics the sound design the simplicity the complexity theres truly nothing like getting headshot through a wall times a match by a year old who paid for his cheats and will now proceed to ruin minutes of your already precious free time valve are a joke this game is a joke the anticheat does absolutely nothing subtick is objectively worse than tick which valve were too cheap to implement the updates this game gets are absolutely shocking so many game modes are still missing and instead of improvements to the constant rubber banding we get more skin cases and tiny adjustments to gameplay if that no surf no working community servers no retakes no decent deathmatch no working trustfactor no working anticheat no subtick system that actually works theres a reason why every pro tournament is played on tick valve you cheap moneygrabbing layabouts valve you are so lucky to have the playerbase you have for counterstrike it brings in millions of dollars every week stop pissing that away with your complete inaction i havent touched this game in months and honestly very little would get me to return youre killing the playerbase and frankly the people who continue to buy these pathetic loot crates are too stop opening cases stop giving these lazy arseholes money then they might actually do something but until then this game isnt worth your time your sanity or your money,Counter Strike 2
dogshit game cheater every single game eu servers new tick shit completely dogwater crazy they released the alpha of csgo as a new game,Counter Strike 2
fix the goddamn hit registration this is unplayable now,Counter Strike 2
retarded game go fk urself bunch of cunts,Counter Strike 2
all the players are toxic dont play it,Counter Strike 2
i had k hours logged on another account before playing on this one reached global elite a long time ago but coming back to the game it just feels so bland its broken full of cheaters and valve is too lazy to make their own stuff so they have to rely primarily on the community and there isnt just problems with cs but also tf with players going away from keyboard to farm cheaters and just being a bad game in general modern day i dont mind playing for fun but itll never be the same nor will it ever be as good as it used to be,Counter Strike 2
completely unplayable the anticheat does not work therefore the game is quite literally unplayable it could be a very good game it could be so much fun but unfortunately valve is unable to provide a working anticheat cheaters in every single game the only option to actually play the game is via faceit,Counter Strike 2
worst game ever,Counter Strike 2
poor performance compared to other esports first person shooter shooters especially bad for my amd gpu anticheat in my lobbies at my silver level i dont see any obvious cheaters but apparently they are everywhere higher up on the skill ladder gameplay as you know is noice still currently performance is a dealbreaker for me,Counter Strike 2
this game is terrible try siege instead,Counter Strike 2
too many cheaters and no one is doing something to prevent this,Counter Strike 2
meh boring and dated slot machine with a team first person shooter game on the side,Counter Strike 2

they need to make a in game safe for weapon skins even though steam guard is suppose to protect your items russian hackers still manage to get into steam accounts easily it doesnt matter what security you have they will get in easily i changed my email password authorized devices and switched all private information with a malware scanning everyday and they still managed to smash and grab over items csgo and steam both know that csgo is a prime candidate for this tactic i just wished that they would implement something in game as a lock since steam cant protect anything might as well lay out the red carpet for them im done playing this game too many hacker with prime then why buy prime no item proctection in game csgo inventory to get stolen in all other games csgo to csgo transition all new mechanics spray pattern non existent,Counter Strike 2
game makes me wanna do very bad things to good people,Counter Strike 2

dont try this game,Counter Strike 2
removed support from mac devices cant even play the game and cant play csgo anymore so theres no way fro me to play counter strike anymore,Counter Strike 2
so i like this game but the people on it are so vile and toxic if you mute comms also is good anticheat away from being better than valorant,Counter Strike 2
been playing a little more actively lately found that i keep getting votekicked by bot accounts multiple accounts with the same name will simply raid a match and vote kick everyone out valve at this point we might as well find a different game fix the bot issues,Counter Strike 2
tinder has less cheaters,Counter Strike 2
absolutely miserable,Counter Strike 2
absolutly shit full of chaters and just not fun to play no more fix thix pish,Counter Strike 2
i stopped playing some years back because of the amount of cheaters somehow in its even worse dont waste your time on this crap,Counter Strike 2
crash all the time,Counter Strike 2
do not dedicate yourself to css matchmaking go to faceit only put up with it to get free drops then leave and dont even think about coming back to grind for the ranks not worth it maybe once the anticheat actually works and cheaters are gone then you can go but ill probably still opt for faceit mm but if youre in a region without one right now just play casual dont waste your time playing a game where valve doesnt even put money to dedicate itself for a better anticheat in a faster manner months have gone by and still cheaters dominate the mm disappointed in what the game has become and my words come from a major perspective,Counter Strike 2
the current game environment of this game is very bad the game official does not deal with cheating players the optimization is still very poor and frame drops and freezes often affect the game experience when encountering enemies official matchmaking often encounters cheating players and matchmaking platforms often encounter cheating so doesnt valve care about these issues if there is a newcomer who wants to play this game hopefully he will be mentally prepared because he often encounters cheating players,Counter Strike 2
the game looks disgusting everything is so sweet and pretty that i want to vomit they ruined this game and the tone of it another trash aimed at kids to play ill wait till fashion comes back to normal this crap is unplayable,Counter Strike 2
get ready to get called a n,Counter Strike 2
cs just looks a little better but handles worse than csgo awful tick servers mean hit reg is god awful ranking is still terrible a year after release and not nearly enough anticheat smurfs everywhere because top premier rankings are infested with cheaters but hey strikebuystrike rent some skins and shut up,Counter Strike 2
new subtick system is shit biggest mistake for new players is ok but for good players is like a joke,Counter Strike 2
a trashy support and very weird bannings i got banned for killing the cheater in my team imagine ahahahahaha idiots they needed years of development for this shit and than they forget about the anti cheat ahahahahahahahhaha,Counter Strike 2

this game gonna ruin your life,Counter Strike 2
none stable still bagged and a lot of cheatershackers,Counter Strike 2
vac stands for valve allows cheaters,Counter Strike 2
so stupid system free to play wooow then if you dont pay prime you only play with godmode cheaters who ever had this idea needs to learn from other games like valorant,Counter Strike 2
all achievements achieved i mean what can i really say here its csgo with a slapped on the front for a new engine just like overwatch the game is good the people not so good flooded with hackers and racists,Counter Strike 2
worst game ever valve allows cheaters to do as they want the anticheat is nonexistent dont play this game dont play any game by valve actually,Counter Strike 2
when there is glitches or issues with skins cases or anything that directly makes valve money they will fix the problem before you can even pronounce the word problem however their lazy ass dev team still refuses to do shit about the cheating problem even if you buy prime you will play against fat fucks that cant do anything but cheat its so bad that instead of asking yourself whos cheating you should probably ask whos not cheating its killing the playerbase but as long as people keep buying cases they dont give a shit,Counter Strike 2
trash game i ever play cheater everywhere,Counter Strike 2
i think id give up garlic bread before actually enjoying this game,Counter Strike 2
valve treats this game like tf,Counter Strike 2
k hours overall and i only play this game out of spite,Counter Strike 2
this game is trash csgo should have stuck around huge miss and they took away the best wingman maps like rialto and lake the only thing better here is the modern graphics other than that this game is worse than csgo in literally every other way,Counter Strike 2
get off of the game please,Counter Strike 2
this game is unbelievably popular and for a good reason its fun that being said this game has by far the most toxic community i have ever seen and there is no comparison i have heard more racial slurs playing counter strike than i have in every other aspect of my life combined fun game bad community,Counter Strike 2
laggy mess ever since the implementation of csgo ridiculous that a company this size cannot figure out these issues in a timely manner not to mention the lack of updates regarding operations and the community,Counter Strike 2
this is a cheating shitshow you literally cant play a game without cheaters,Counter Strike 2
cases opened everyday so i guess the actual game doesnt matter gamblers paradise,Counter Strike 2
maan where are we gonna get a good anti cheat,Counter Strike 2

this is worst version of cs the cheating is pretty rampant alot of wallhacks going on if thats not whats going on then positional audio is overtuned theres no matchmaking you just get stuck in the same server with the same people over and over again they still havent figured out interpolation its a lot of fun getting killed by someone with ping when i have and i shot first s or my favorite not seeing them first but they can see me its bad dont waste your time,Counter Strike 2
please review your griefing reports ban pls i dont even do anything on the last months and i got days ban whats the indicator for griefing report to give me that long,Counter Strike 2

i lost my wife and my house too gambling,Counter Strike 2
games crammed full of hackers which is probably good for valve because it looks like they all leave positive reviews also the lack of maps seems like a pretty hefty trade off for a minor graphical update,Counter Strike 2

game is good has excellent things in fact but its just all cheaters and vac dont care would recommend if you dont mind people spin botting or walling or aim cheating on you miss the old recoil patterns but if youre new it wont matter,Counter Strike 2
played csgo for + hours all the time it worked on my mbp one day they silently replaced my csgo installation with cs executable which no more worked on macos it is still shown when filtering games that are ready to run on macos yet appears to download the huge cs pack and then it additionally downloads gb csgolegacy which does literally nothing unless you are a years old boy actually wanting to play with bots so they were uncaring so much so they have not even removed the game from macoscompatible on steam no way i will pay money to cs anymore for inability and complexity of making the game multiplatform unpaid enthusiasts made a port of cs which smoothly runs right inside my browser thats pretty enough to play true cs especially i am content with being vanilla without those wildly painted guns for years old kids sure valve probably doesnt have that good software engineers i understand,Counter Strike 2

disastrous automatic team balancing no action against cheaters the game isnt very well optimized and a lesser csgo release except for a few grenades called cs im probably forgetting things to talk about but this cs would have deserved a few more years of work and above all active and competent devs,Counter Strike 2

counterstrike used to be more than just a competitive game having been powered by the community and their own servers cs wouldnt be able to achieve what it has today that said cs is an abomination css only focus is their competitive audience but cares so little for the social communitydriven servers groups and networks that they even killed off csgo making it completely inaccessible online even for community servers which supported the best communitydesigned maps and game modes the upgrades cs made over csgo completely destroyed counterstrikes oldest perhaps greatest communitydriven servers and maps known as surf this isnt even the worst thing they broke regarding community content as the community server browser is now detached from the game itself and has remained broken or at least barely functional since the launch of cs,Counter Strike 2
this game makes me mad,Counter Strike 2
the helicopter apex predators are very scary,Counter Strike 2
fuck this game pay to win cry cry wawa babys,Counter Strike 2

shitgame to be honest,Counter Strike 2
its fun when everyones legit sure problem is cheaters are here every other game,Counter Strike 2
vac valve allows hack cant do anything when hackers are ruling the game such a disappointment whatever this game is good or bad,Counter Strike 2
absolute trash game ruined after csgo too much lag,Counter Strike 2

stupid game does not protect your inventory its rigged to control the items in the market,Counter Strike 2
source is superior which is saying something,Counter Strike 2
the voice chat and the players that use it in this game are a blessing but the game has a huge issue that is consistent and has remained since feb regardless of your ping and video settings the game will lag heavy prompting it unplayable,Counter Strike 2
mediocre and dated,Counter Strike 2
this is the opposite of sam i do not want to fuck it this game fucking sucks,Counter Strike 2
attempted to play ranked game game crashed to desktop got stuck on downlading content trying to launch the game had to uninstall the game manually delete the game folder as deleting it on steam did not uninstall the game after reinstalling the game and getting the game to finally launch i was able to get to the main menu and faced with a competitive cooldown mins thanks for wasting my time,Counter Strike 2
l game,Counter Strike 2
this game is actually awful and it doesnt ever seem to get better repetitive unrealistic and just plain not fun its probably the worst mainstream first person shooter currently and its obvious the game devs havent cared for a long time find a better use of your time like i didnt bring back old cs,Counter Strike 2
game has issues crashing and not restarting without a full uninstall and reinstall verify integrity of game files does not work restarting my machine doesnt work this game is shit and the devs should eat shit,Counter Strike 2
fck this they dont care about the game like they should and well i guess i do not care anymore either dumbass company,Counter Strike 2
too many hackers drastic fall after the update,Counter Strike 2
never play this game the game is full of cheaters the game does not have an anticheat program,Counter Strike 2
team game with tk and no ff like what,Counter Strike 2
online gambling with a half working minigame attached,Counter Strike 2
too many cheaters and too little action done by valve to give a positive review,Counter Strike 2
another cheaterfest by valve,Counter Strike 2
game was extremely good during csgo the ability to run servers at tick felt free and played better than matchmaking valve in their infinite wisdom decided to create subtick but cap it to so that the game produces a significantly worse rubber banding experience than miss servers even with low ping i have more than hours in this game produced mainly while playing csgo and have around ish at most hours of playing cs this change is absolutely trash he grenades blind you if someone peaks after it explodes since they can see through the dust cloud but you cant the graphics are cranked up to so you cant focus on things that are truly important because for some reason theyre trying to make this a aaa game gun fightsspraying feel terrible due to subtick being trash peakers delight if youre terrible and just like to run and gun you will most likely be rewarded and the anticheat doesnt do its job half of the time making wall hackers rampant additionally i cannot get over the fact that a plethora of lvl or accounts with hours are pumping me like i am on orange youtube and competitive is now a joke i cant do it anymore as a community we need to start saying no to companies that keep making changes that arent welcomed or wanted this entire thing is now a joke and id rather spend my time elsewhere you win valve i dont want to play my favorite game anymore,Counter Strike 2
we that buyed cs go should get prime status upgrade free,Counter Strike 2
bad game,Counter Strike 2
the game is still full of cheaters literally unplayable,Counter Strike 2
played and enjoyed the game in uninstalled and went outside came back and saw hype for cs redownloaded and hate everything about the game maybe im not the audience for it anymore,Counter Strike 2
anticheat is nonexistent cheater every game,Counter Strike 2
best way to find a cheater but its a shity game,Counter Strike 2
shit game you gonna get no bitches no money no nothing,Counter Strike 2
fucking awful dont ever play this game,Counter Strike 2
that game needs to review,Counter Strike 2
im honestly dissapointed at this point the game is ofc very good but it really feels like valve doesnt care about it at least communicate please,Counter Strike 2
csgo was amazing cs is literal dogshi t valve ruins everything they touch the ranks mean nothing the matchmaking is shit the game runs like doodoo way to ruin an amazing game been out for two years and they still cant get the matchmaking anywhere near right silver isnt silver gold nova isnt gold nova and so on premier is even worse what a joke of an update to a really well balanced ranking system absolutely destroyed a very good game and turned it into trash aim flinch does nothing now grenades remove smoke the peeker always wins every fight i mean its not even close to the game they had previously built oh but they dont care because theyre making a boatload of money from the different monetization routes theyve established prime means nothing you will get cheaters throwers and toxic worthless trash every single match you will do amazing one match and then the next it will put you with people that have x your elo and rank so that you lose without getting rounds in i cannot express how garbage of a fucking game it is now i remember when csgo was a paid game the minute they went free to play i knew it was over wasted so much of my life on a shit game with horrid hitreg no support no nothing they just ruin everything that was once good and turned it into a pile of flaming shit ggs valve great job,Counter Strike 2
cheaters like everywhere with spinbot and such i`ve got guys with spinbots who i was playing against months ago and they still playing without a ban,Counter Strike 2
dogshit game dont waste your time,Counter Strike 2
horrible fing game after the change from csgo this game became a piece of crap havent been able to endure more than one day of playing this garbage,Counter Strike 2
we never needed this its definitely what we asked for but not what we needed because this wouldve been such a perfect oppurtunity to fix literally everything except nothing gets fixed instead we get good graphics which is overrated,Counter Strike 2
no working anti cheat for over years at least we have new skins am i right straight up useless devs who remove content so they can re release it in the future for praise you should be embarrassed valve,Counter Strike 2
fix backtrack why is it still exist,Counter Strike 2
you must be stupid if you think there is such a thing as a legit player on this game do yourself a favour and dont touch this hot garbage,Counter Strike 2
well now cooper lemme tell ya about this here counterstrike boy i aint been this disappointed since my hound dog ran off with the neighbors cat this game aint nothin like the good ol days i tell ya what first off the graphics they mighta polished em up a bit but it dont hold a candle to the charm of them old blocky textures we had back in the day its like slappin lipstick on a pig it still aint no beauty queen and the gameplay lord have mercy back in my day we had ourselves a real shootin match none of this fancyschmancy runnin around like a chicken with its head cut off the guns dont feel right cooper the recoils got more bounce than a bullfrog in a bucket and the hitboxes dont get me started theyre jankier than a bustedup pickup on a dirt road then theres the maps they took classics like dust and turned em into a dang maze i got lost quicker than a tumbleweed in a windstorm they aint got no respect for the old ways just messin with perfection for the sake of it and dont even mention the community used to be youd find folks who knew how to play a proper game now its filled with more squeakers and cheaters than a county fair pieeatin contest aint no fun when half the folks youre playin with are glitchin and hackin shoot cooper if i wanted to deal with this much frustration id just try to teach a pig to sing counterstrike it aint worth the powder to blow it to hell i give it a miserable outta starrated boners aint nothin but a heap of broken promises and shattered dreams if youre lookin for some real shootin fun you best stick to the classics this here newfangled version aint fit for nothin but linein the bottom of a birdcage hell no cooper save yer money and git yerself somethin worthwhile,Counter Strike 2
cheaters,Counter Strike 2
fix the ramps my god,Counter Strike 2
i cant talk with women,Counter Strike 2
too much server lag game is not optimised csgo version was optimise that time but know there are so many hackers and server lag,Counter Strike 2

fromsoft,Elden Ring
hard as hell but good as hell,Elden Ring
its a lot of fun would recommend having a side quest guide open on your second screen to knock them all out,Elden Ring
steep learning curve off the bat just know you can explore the open world if you get stuck just move on and get stronger elsewhere come back when you feel youre in a good headspace for a challenge,Elden Ring
its hard its good just try it,Elden Ring
i cant return to my normal life after this,Elden Ring
not for softies,Elden Ring
its so fun and with the new dlc its even better,Elden Ring
get good i havent yet to fight some very unfair bosses who pretty much one shot,Elden Ring
yes,Elden Ring
best game ever,Elden Ring
i may rage but i just need to git gud,Elden Ring
ive beaten the game around three times and im almost done with the dlc and all i have to say is that elden ring is peak fiction absolute cinema yes the dlc is hard but we were told by fromsoft that it would be hard personally i believe that the main reason why people say elden ring was easy was because of the open world aspect and just being able to grab op weapons by only fighting side bosses otherwise its fun you should play it,Elden Ring
the review bombing is a bit silly some enemies are arguable a little too tanky but not enough to make it bad its still a ridiculously good expansion,Elden Ring
angy,Elden Ring
i preferred dss controls also this makes the keyboard on my poor laptop run so hot that it actually burns my fingers off awful but it is a beautiful game very scenic,Elden Ring
dlc is too easy,Elden Ring
dr pebba,Elden Ring
great game,Elden Ring
fight die explore get better fight die fight win repeat with friends for x the experience,Elden Ring
great game a lot to explore a lot to learn but overcoming those challenges makes the game all the more rewarding if something is too hard try a different approach no game is unbeatable the landscapes are amazing combat is thrilling and the lore is deep would recommend to anyone interested in the franchise,Elden Ring
this and terraria might be the best games in existence,Elden Ring
what the sigma,Elden Ring
very good love this game and the dlc has very fun weapons and weapon skills,Elden Ring
best game ever made same for dlc outside of some initial glitches which they immediately fix i recommend it to everyone,Elden Ring

how many times you died today yes,Elden Ring
overprized shit just for it to beeing easier than sekiro,Elden Ring
the greatest of all time of games,Elden Ring
best game ever,Elden Ring
my order of elden rings comes with a side of shadow of the erdtree,Elden Ring
ive never been one for soulslike games but something about elden ring is absolutely captivating the world is stunning and there is nothing like playing for minutes to only be humbled by a man on a horse,Elden Ring
oh you dont have the right oh you dont have the right oh you dont have the right oh you dont have the right oh you dont have the right,Elden Ring
pain and tutorials the only two things that you are going to have in elden ring,Elden Ring
amazing game very difficult but the game does give you the tools to beat anything in the game the pvp is super fun and exciting to learn as well,Elden Ring
this game touched me as a kid,Elden Ring
goated,Elden Ring
best game ever made,Elden Ring
this is a hard game but i loved it out of all the firmsoft games this is the only one that kept pulling me back wanting to try again i have not beaten the game but because of it i want to go back and play other games like it,Elden Ring
love ahead therefore try elden ring,Elden Ring
niall is the elden ring dlc is amazing this game makes me hate myself,Elden Ring
no complaints besides dying a little too much,Elden Ring
glad i didnt kill myself yet and got to play the dlc,Elden Ring
you already know why im recommending this play it and become elden lord,Elden Ring
no other rpg aside from the witcher can compare to this game and the dlc it is a masterpiece would recommend to anyone,Elden Ring
h brutal annoyingh i think everyone should give b elden ringb a chance and although i have an antipathy to soulslike games i tried it only because of the hype do i regret it not at all but there were a lot of things that bothered me first of all i have to say that we are getting a complete comprehensive game at a fair price it was designed from the beginning so that nothing was cut out like in other games the game world is incredibly varied and the bosses are ruthless and the possibilities are endless my main problem with the game is not the difficulty but the movements and the battle camera the characters movement is too clunky and all these forward rolls backward rolls sideways rolls that you do are too slow there should be a way to dodge attacks faster and further my little yearold brother can do forward rolls faster than the character in the game this camera control is giving me eye cancer sometimes you cant see anything at all when youre aiming at the enemy and trying to avoid their attacks because you almost get an epileptical attack from all the explosions and lightning and everything else then there is the story which is told in an extremely cryptic way i understand almost nothing i have watched hours of youtube videos about the lore and everything else and i still dont understand it maybe there isnt much to understand i just have to accept it i find it extremely annoying that so little is explained i have to read through the wiki so often to understand how something works and why doesnt the game tell me that when i die and my runes which i have collected with such effort are dropped at the place where i died and then when i die again they are gone forever a small info display for that would have been nice then a few little things that annoy me there is no ultrawide support and there is a first person shooter limit the game uses easyanticheat so you would have to turn it off and mod the game to be able to play with ultrawide and more first person shooter,Elden Ring
master peak thank you fromsoftware,Elden Ring
got it gifted to me when it released didnt like it much came back years later now its the best game i own,Elden Ring
i love this game,Elden Ring
they shouldnt have nerfed it because it was to hard thats the whole point of the game its a souls like the best souls like if you will it has a awesome looking open world and on top of that the story and or lore is amazing i beat the dlc pre nerf and wouldnt want to be any easier im a better player and also the excietment of beating those bosses were the best out of would recommend,Elden Ring
this game is truly generational you can tell the devs poured their heart and soul into everything in this game a truly unique open world rpg experience if you are new to the franchise please do yourself a favor and play this masterpiece dont forget the dlc as well this game is truly sensational,Elden Ring
hours++ full of fun frustation and sense of achievement get seamless mods to have fun with friends,Elden Ring
a masterpiece of the soulsgenre highly reccomened but bloodborne and ds still the best,Elden Ring
fuck this game,Elden Ring
needed to git gudder so i threw a tantrum about it and waited to be validated by other people who think they shouldnt be challenged would cry again,Elden Ring
the game,Elden Ring
i am not good at this game out of,Elden Ring
ive been waiting to write a review for so long because being a fromsoft fan i knew the dlc would be elden ring at its best i wasnt wrong with that assumption however the dlc in my opinion needs to be bought with the base game there are reveals and things that happen in the dlc that make the rest of the game a far more cohesive and enjoyable in my opinion experience the story feels complete with the dlc that being said i love this game it has its weird or questionable moments but other than that i truly believe its a masterpiece everyone whos even the slightest bit interested should try for themselves,Elden Ring
i have never written a review for any games so you can imagine how much this game and its dlc have impressed me the base game is amazing the map is huge and you can spend hours upon hours exploring it to your hearts content and find valuable and outright op weapons that you can abuse i looked up a guide for the golden seeds and sacred tears because i just wanted to max out my flasks and finish the game dark souls style where i just focus on the combat and fight the bosses the game is designed for you to take advantage of the items you have at your disposal the phrase git gud gets thrown a lot especially after the dlc but i believe if you truly play the game on your own and dont copy a build off the internet you are good people have been review bombing the dlc for it being too hard which i believe is not fair the dlcs in the souls series have always been harder than the base game but elden ring has accumulated a way larger fan base than dark souls and a lot of attention brought a lot of broken builds that trivialized the game for a lot of players so these players that looked up different builds for their character are having trouble with the dlc because there arent a lot of broken builds in the dlc because its still fresh out the oven if you plan to look up builds or what items to use to cheese the game please dont waste your time and just watch a stream because you wont get any satisfaction from the game if you plan to play the game on your own you will love every second of this game even if your build is op it is your build even if you use summons magic spirit ashes which are commonly frowned upon in the community it is still your character in an rpg game that you have spent hours optimizing i watched a streamer beat prime radhan the final boss of the dlc with a weapon that dealt way much more damage than mine and another that cheesed it with a greatshield its only cheesing if your chat builds you character for you but i couldnt bring myself to throw away my trusty claymore with which i have finished every souls game to have a better chance at beating the boss this stubborness finally paid off after hours upon hours of fighting prime radhan with my claymore because i could really say i beat him not another streamer or player that found an optimized build to trivialize the game,Elden Ring
game is alright i guess,Elden Ring
i guess they removed the little blue bear,Elden Ring
yes,Elden Ring
literally the greatest of all time,Elden Ring
those stripped of the grace of gold shall all meet death in the embrace of messmers flame,Elden Ring
visual and gameplay masterpiece with obscure but compelling storyline it heralds a new age of gaming for open world genre if you are new to soulslike series this is the best game for you,Elden Ring
likely pickle,Elden Ring
i think the base game is fun challenging enough that makes me want to go back to each boss i do think the dlc is not as good as i had hoped all enemies do so much damage and the bosses kill you with max health in only thee hits all bosses have persistent attacks that give off very few opportunities to do much,Elden Ring
i mean like yes its one of the best games ever made you just have to be prepared for a heart attack in your s with no previous symptoms i almost quit the base game over fire giant and i almost quit the dlc over the final boss i guess i like pain and punishment and sadness and stratospheric levels of stress and pain again although i really dont i just couldnt stop playing it so thanks from software and miyazakisan for making me even more confused about what i want out of life oh yeh for anyone with younger brothers who play games together remember when you were kids and you used to button mash on any tekken game and just wait for your brother to go nuts and throw his controller at you yeh thats exactly what miyazaki is doing to us with the dlc final boss i knew my brother would get his revenge one day i just didnt think hed be so cruel about it,Elden Ring
of course what could i say just play the game,Elden Ring
cant believe they made a dlc about me,Elden Ring
more dark souls is always great openworld dark souls kinda lacks replayability once you explore everything but who cares its a hr+ first playthrough dlc is horrifying glad it wont be over in a day,Elden Ring
a great game a combination of the best of what every game fromsoft has made up until this point,Elden Ring
i try and i try and i lose and lose over and over again and again,Elden Ring
all things can be conjoined miriel,Elden Ring
one of the best from fromsoft,Elden Ring
a dlc bigger and better than most full aaa games,Elden Ring
the game is quite fun ounce you learn the basics and if you want to play the game use a intelagance build or a blead build because other builds need an increased leval of not fucking up constantly,Elden Ring
somehow made a review of shadow of the erdtree before elden ring its good play it if you like hard games,Elden Ring
you are not worthy o you are not worthy you are not worthy o you are not worthy you are not worthy o you are not worthy you are not worthy o you are not worthy <,Elden Ring
its hard as hell but fun as hell,Elden Ring
i feel like i have ascended to a other world,Elden Ring
one of the best games ever made,Elden Ring
i am absolutely blown away by this game i originally bought it when it came out didnt get very far and didnt think it was for me revisited it with all the dlc hype and i was totally wrong this game is consuming all my free time its one of the most engaging games ive played in so long that feels so rewarding to overcome all the challenges true character progression and learning more about the game its lore and the lands between has been incredible and im so happy i gave it a second chance,Elden Ring
amazing world and story just the right amount of challenge that makes the game engaging,Elden Ring
one of the best souls game and love the dlc,Elden Ring
new award game of the decade dlc game of the year yes,Elden Ring
miyazaki has me in such a chokehold with this,Elden Ring
fromsoft makes my favorite games and i always look forward to each of their releases elden ring is the most approachable fromsoft game and it is absolutely fantastic they went so hard and it shows side note i do think its a bit silly that it garnered a community that constantly argues over what the right way to kill a boss is,Elden Ring
very fun and relaxing game the kids will love it,Elden Ring
this game is simply amazing ive played dark souls sekiro and bloodborne prior to this but my god this tops it all of even my girlfriend who does not like this kind of games started to play elden ring world design story bosses areas and secret areas npcs soundtrack everything,Elden Ring
endless pain and suffering,Elden Ring
this is my first souls game and i have to say hands down the best game ive ever played,Elden Ring
this game is an epic beautiful and worthy of all praise will play it over and over again postscript if you cannot beat the dlc i am sorry to hear you are a disappointment to your bloodline,Elden Ring
fantastic game a bit too easy though and i think it needs more waterfowl dance and also give every boss bleed other than that a solid,Elden Ring
its the greatest video game ever made full stop,Elden Ring
goated,Elden Ring
game,Elden Ring
best game ever made,Elden Ring
according to all known laws of aviation there is no way a bee should be able to fly its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground the bee of course flies anyway because bees dont care what humans think is impossible yellow black yellow black yellow black yellow black,Elden Ring
finally was able to get out and touch g̶r̶a̶s̶s̶ grace,Elden Ring
very fun to play with homies w buy,Elden Ring
yes,Elden Ring
base game is fantastic played most of the soulsborne games minus sekiro the dlc alone is massive it almost feels like a second game hoping we get performance updates and patches soon cause the first person shooter drop during some of the fights and the npc aggro tracking for sure needs work other than that its a great game and i reccomend it to all beginner soulsborne players,Elden Ring
good game and dlc,Elden Ring
i hate this game,Elden Ring
if your game has hours average playtime in length youve peaked as a game dev this shit is awesome,Elden Ring
you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died you died enemy felled get rekt noob easy game,Elden Ring
a good game ruined by its open world and recycled bosses if they just scrapped the open world this could have been the best souls game out but it only lead too a mass amount of recycled bosses and empty areas dungeons arent fun when its the th one and it looks the same however apart from that the bosses are fun too fight and the mix of weapons are great,Elden Ring
everyone knows this game is amazing from the gameplay to the world building and art design its a near perfect game i should have recommended it years ago but it is never too late,Elden Ring
an absolutely wonderful game it is the best through any category game that ive ever played,Elden Ring
just goated,Elden Ring
good harcore game,Elden Ring
great game ahead therefore try joy,Elden Ring
really good game totally would recommend,Elden Ring
game is good,Elden Ring
friend wanted me to get it for forever and kept saying i would finally did and im hooked buy it do it,Elden Ring
i have never played a souls game and i find this pretty enjoyable even if its slow paced for myself in regards to progress through trial and error i still progress steadily great game,Elden Ring
dark souls no need to say more it fucking slaps play it i want to go home and then edge,Elden Ring
this game is truly a one of a kind experience a kin to the first time in open water or flying in an airplane it cant well be described its not as hard as the darksouls games and gives you unparalleled freedom it is a great challenge none the less you will see things far more creative than your own wildest dreams magnificent in design a true masterpiece if i do say so myself i recomend the game for anyone who has patience nothing excessive give or take a boss or haha if you have a hunger for adventure and exploration this game is a thanksgiving dinner made by granny herself at whatever price point the game is being sold atit is worth every penny if you see it on salemug someone i do not know go into debt its just so good i cant believe its not butter postscript most enjoyable with an xbox controller in my opinion too long i did not read game is one of a kind hard buy,Elden Ring
fromsoftware makes me hard,Elden Ring
greatest game i have ever played bar none,Elden Ring
the games simply wonderful with the base game providing a lot of fun and challenge for newcomers and the dlc providing a hefty difficulty spike for those who think they know it all if you like the souls series definitely check the base game out and consider the dlc its certainly not for everyone but its one hell of a time,Elden Ring
best game easily,Elden Ring
yes,Elden Ring
hours of playing and still didnt defeat godrick the grafted but its still fun hehe <,Elden Ring
great game i love,Elden Ring
never go to caelid,Elden Ring
very good game thank you from software,Elden Ring
amazing game made me want to kill myself,Elden Ring
from the base game to the dlc this is a masterpiece this might be the greatest game of all time might not be my personal favorite but it is top,Elden Ring
very fun game but fire giant annoying boss and so is red wolf of radagon,Elden Ring
to the people that say this game and dlc is hard just gitgud story ost overall,Elden Ring
is this yharnam,Elden Ring
i love the incredible world building of the game a from soft fan through and through so may be biased,Elden Ring
beat tall guy with hammer life good,Elden Ring
another classic from fromsoft one of the best souls games made and would highly recommend for anyone into the souls series or anyone who is a fan of rpgs i will say that there is one minor drawback of replayability as a lot of the side bosses are often recycled however the lack of replayability is made up for by the entire game being jam packed with content,Elden Ring
each like i would save money for dlc,Elden Ring
iam writing this review after completing hours of play time so far my only progress is beating the tree sentinel it took me hours to beat tree sentinel i want to kill myself now,Elden Ring
i could not recommend this game enough this is truly a game everyone has to play at least once definitely the best game i have ever played,Elden Ring
first of the dlc is absolutely beautiful i´ve slayen most of the bosses by now and everyone of them was memoriable with cool designe and music the only issue the dlc have is the miserable performance but this is something they will fix eventually what i dont understand is the hate this dlc gets the pepole are whinning over the difficulty of the bosses and instead of getting good or using the op mimic tear they´re constandly complaining that the bosses were to aggressive and there combos to long i dont get it the fromsoftware games are famouse for there difficulty the whole soulslike subgenre is based upon these games everybody who plays these games should understand that there game journey is full of frustration and dying over and over especially the new players who played no soulslike or fromsoftware game before,Elden Ring
absolute peak of a dlc my literally only problem is the abyssal woods area felt underutilized for its large size and also no use of torrent and the scadutrees getting buffed in this patch but other than that def gonna run through this game a few more times,Elden Ring
if you cant beat it get gud,Elden Ring
first soulsgame i have ever played and honestly its so good a must try,Elden Ring
beat the lving shit out of my son would recommend,Elden Ring
ive enjoyed the game a little bit,Elden Ring
theyve done it again,Elden Ring
great role playing game where you role play as the victim,Elden Ring
greatest game,Elden Ring
i already beat this game this is my alt haha,Elden Ring
yes,Elden Ring
open world dark souls with some influence from sekiro and bloodborne thrown in its all gravy the dlc is even better and is approximately at least percent of the main games landmass with about as much content so its more of a sequel than just an expansion but erdtree and the main game is worth the asking price or a sale runs great on my pc and i have a fairly modest set up a amd x and an rtx if i turn on raytracing to maximum i get some dips but its definitely playable like the console version while looking a touch better without raytracing i get a locked first person shooter on max settings,Elden Ring
i actually started playing elden ring on the postscript back when i first came out but sinds last year i have been playing it on steam too might as well leave a review this game kinda saved my life back in i was in a dark place and needed help cheers for mental health crisis without going to much in detail i was on a waaaayy to long waiting list for help and i just needed to wait it out in the hope i didnt do the big selfdeleting in the meantime i took a gamble and started to playing elden ring in the hope this would keep me busy i love open world games but i wasnt the biggest souls fan i fell in love with the game sooo fucking hard that i manged to keep me sane while the game driving me insane sometimes but hey that is what makes this game so great exploring all there is and that fucking dopamina hit when the screen showed god slain after the big end boss it was what kept me going and comming back years later i am in a much beter place and getting my live back together still madly in love with this game enjoying the dlc and have a half sleeve tattoo of maliketh best boss in short this game helped me immensely to stay sane during a crisis would try fingers but whole again,Elden Ring
great game,Elden Ring
its a souls game that should say it all,Elden Ring
this game is a masterpiece,Elden Ring
the base game is great been playing it since it came out the visuals are incredible and the boss fights are even better i was very excited to play the new dlc when it came out and it sure didnt disappoint its a lot harder and makes you think and strategize with your builds and things its everything i always wanted it to be if youre that much of a wuss that you have to leave a bad review because its too hard maybe you just suck at the game or shouldnt play souls games lolll,Elden Ring
easiest game ever i love it,Elden Ring
good game ds better,Elden Ring

dlc made it better i was going to wait until after i completed the dlc to give it a proper full review but i feel like this needs to be done now to counteract the stupidity of some of the playerbase that isnt happy about how you need to actually play the game to play the game its good stop whining about not wanting to get better at a game based around its difficulty and sense of achievement from getting better at the game,Elden Ring
who wouldnt recommend the best game known to grace this planet,Elden Ring

best game everdied + times geci jo,Elden Ring
received for free = won in a giveaway this is in no way shape or form a requested review in the words of mark from rdc world im unsponsored so i can say whatever i want hadnt seriously played a souls title since dark souls at launch didnt tolerate or and absolutely hated the fact that the industry tried to constantly replicate and copy the same game type only to leave many jaded i wanted to love code vein really did but no that being said going into elden ring years after its release was good for me its souls so expect to get hit times and either die or be close to death each area cleared feels like a mini triumph with most bosses being infuriatingly thrilling true to fromsofts style enemies are constant level skill and gear checks but past the fact that of this game world is constantly trying to stun lock and kill you the environments are gorgeous from the expansive views to the muggy feeling of walking through a catacomb and seeing blood pools everywhere it was truthfully a gift to have played dark souls and still retain enough knowledge to take the silly messages in stride and to muscle through the constant deaths in areas where my build just isnt suitable only thing im not liking at this particular point is the fact that greatswords seem to be the way to go most if not all the time when your dagger longsword katana whip or whatever you may have doesnt stagger certain enemies greatswords seem to push right on through and get that stagger or knockback youd want in your normal weaponry otherwise this aint for the weak easily discouraged or overly stubborn in the wrong places peep prepare position and poke,Elden Ring
posting this cos the dlc came out fun game good exploration large map with lots of weapons and bosses and you can coop or fight other players,Elden Ring
best game thats it,Elden Ring
its a good game,Elden Ring
yes,Elden Ring
best game i have played in a very long time the king of game you dream about and wish was real when you are a kid,Elden Ring
best game ever but it too easy for me,Elden Ring
like the amount of time it can consume and not feel like a waste,Elden Ring
love this game,Elden Ring
i hope the developers dont lower the difficulty on the new dlc bosss this has been the challenge everyone wants,Elden Ring
very good game it makes me feel angry,Elden Ring
never played a souls game my computer can barely run this pentium processor and i die so many times still one of the best games ive ever played never had a game make me feel genuinely triumphant after overcoming a challenge like this one does,Elden Ring
one of my favorite games of all time i got the platinum trophy on playstation and just got all the achievements on steam before i play the dlc i highly recommend if you enjoy souls games if youve never played a souls game watch some videos before you try it out because it can be difficult at times,Elden Ring
a fantastic game take thy place as elden lord,Elden Ring
great game no notes,Elden Ring
outstanding expansion the map is beautiful the weapons and armor are amazing and the npc questlines feel more natural and rewarding than the base game the bosses are definitely harder and force you to adapt your playstyle but are doable if you explore and have enough blessings,Elden Ring
not for the feint of heart from soft doesnt pull its punches in difficult gameplay nor should they there are plenty of games out there if you dont like the difficulty either get better at the game through practicing like everyone else or go play a different game,Elden Ring
ive ragequit + times because i cant beat morgott first real boss however my lack of skill should not stop you from playing,Elden Ring
himmel wouldnt leave a bad review,Elden Ring
after playing for hours i am confident in saying i might be ready to fight margit,Elden Ring
probs the best game of the decade i do still prefer ds,Elden Ring
finished the dlc and besides the questionable final boss i dont quite share the sentiment of the people who find the game to be too difficult now its an openworld game and if any of us actually learned a lesson from margit from the first game bashing your head against the wall doesnt work and you get incentivized for actually exploring the rest of the extensive world and actual map created for the dlc i do feel like bosses like gaius messmer and i cannot stress this enough the final boss do have some questionable movesets or design in them that are very frustrating but i feel like it doesnt warrant the amount of hate the game is getting just because they refuse to play the game with the mechanics that are freely available to you if you wish to you control the buttons you press,Elden Ring
this is more of a neutral review but im gonna give the game one more chance as i didnt like it before i wanna like it but the open world isnt for me so im going to play it more linear and see if that helps me enjoy it more,Elden Ring
great game,Elden Ring
best game maybe ever,Elden Ring
best chilling game,Elden Ring
hard but awesome,Elden Ring

this game and its dlc will be regarded as one of the epics in the future alongside films like ben hur and books like the lord of the rings one of the best games i have ever played and is my favourite of all time i have played this on pc and console normal and randomise runs and i still cant get enough,Elden Ring

great game love everything from the buildcrafting and beautiful world to the difficulty of the game and its dlc i hope it gets more than dlc it could go so far with them,Elden Ring
greatest game of all time,Elden Ring
the gaming industry has largely left me disenchanted over the last few years after getting this game recommended to me im disappointed that i didnt try it sooner and that ive been playing other games since its release instead this game is endlessly replayable amd the more you play the more you can objectively improve the way you interact with this world actually feels like you are and not just some nerd clicking a mouse and keyboard and hundreds of apm in an arpg or something this game will frustrate you if its your first time with a soulslike like it was for me but youd do yourself a disservice to pass it by,Elden Ring
i want to go home and then edge,Elden Ring
this game makes me a better man working twords beating a boss builds a stronger wil although i havent slept in hours,Elden Ring
this game has spunk i hate spunk,Elden Ring

first time playing a souls like game best rolling simulator ever i will enjoy this game for many many more hours also fck the flame blowing knife leg bird in stormveil that was tougher to defeat than margit,Elden Ring
elden ring is a masterpiece buy rent do whatever you do to play if you like this kind of game which is like a rollercoster of feelings because you die so many times to one boss you begin hate the boss and after some time you respect them and the fight became a dance between lovers in the end and when you finally win you feel like you are on the top of the world,Elden Ring
one of the best video game ever and one of the best dlc in video game ever,Elden Ring
i hate this game,Elden Ring
one of the best stories ive seen some of the best boss fights ive seen the challenge and scope of this game is amazing environments are high quality and awe inspiring this should be the standard of environments going forward story environmental design character design boss fights ill be the first to admit when i picked it up it felt too large to dive in the fear of missing things grounded my playthrough into the ground picking it up years later i can see where i went wrong and couldnt put it down after an + hour playthrough killing every single boss in the base game and now moving onto a great dlc just after killing messmer i havent been able to put it down highly recommend to any players wanting more challenging gameplay who is willing to put in the effort to improve and to find out more about this huge open world worth every penny,Elden Ring
there was a woman in this game who gave me a hug and also i killed that space bitch that takes you to a moon place she also gave me ahernia from the intense battle,Elden Ring
probably best game i ever played,Elden Ring
i know every bossarena i have been so far like the back of my hand in every little detail because the bosses smeared my face all over it and i like it and if i dont anymore i get me some help from my yellow spirit friends it messes with my sleep schedule in an happy way^^,Elden Ring
best game ever,Elden Ring
i love this game,Elden Ring
game of the century,Elden Ring
was amazing loved the game and loved the dlc before its patch really showed how much i needed to improve my skills and i hope you guys make more games like this and make them very hard so it forces people to take different plans to fight bosses people who compain about the dlc being too hard clearly arent that good and like the easy way,Elden Ring
if you want casual game look no further if casual for you is pain,Elden Ring
try fingers but hole,Elden Ring
peak fromsoftware experience,Elden Ring
elden ring was a first froms game that i played i was shocked of how difficult it was and i relied heavily on heavy armor and heavy weapons pun intended after around + hours playing it actually i clocked to + hours when considering that i was playing offline before i bought it via steam i realized this game is actually a masterpiece because its very technical it has unique pattern where you hit but dont be greedy dodgeblockparry repeat everytime youre facing difficult enemies or bosses you can also use the environment to help you when you put your mind into this game its actually very rewarding i can parry and riposte almost all of the enemies and bosses in the game even in the dlc sometimes it feels im cheating death or more of like calculated gambling if youre just casually playing it you probably wont enjoy elden ring series and the dlc i personally love quality time my love language surprise surprise so i just explored and enjoyed all of the content within the game not rushing it to finish the game as soon as possible it feels like heaven one of the best experience i am having i remember this feeling back then when i first playing gta san andreas you cant forget incredible feeling of video game experience like that thank you from software for this another masterpiece,Elden Ring
very good combat bosses and exploration,Elden Ring
this is not just game of the year this is game of the all time,Elden Ring
challenging but fair a whole world to discover and explore,Elden Ring
review bombers just need to get good amazing dlc you just gotta work for it,Elden Ring
hi ive never played a souls game before this game is very good play it,Elden Ring
perfect souls game,Elden Ring
its the beeeeeest game of my life,Elden Ring
base game dlc would suffer again for a rush tarnished join the fan club of punishment and self inflicted suffering we have milk and cookies jolly coop and even trollish pvp sell your soul today for an unforgettable experience and get a new lease on life welcome to heaven and hell we have convoluted confusing lore and exciting game play with ways to cheese,Elden Ring
it was about hours of content for me well worth the price its very hard but it feels nice they use an alternate leveling system which is actually pretty cool since it sort of puts everyone on similar levels much easier if i was to offer any real complaint theres a really good reason to do npc quest this time around as it thematically leads to an important moment arguably the best story telling fromsoft has ever done but its also really easy to miss all of them even trying to do them i missed a few of them theres no shot without a guide i would have done some of the steps one of which was a huge what since after doing the same thing three times with nothing happening i would have bailed but you need to do it a total of times for it to properly resolve whoever discovered something like that was insane for real though that doesnt really tarnish the enjoyment i got out of the game even if you dont want to use a guide and you dont get that great moment this is a souls game at its finest,Elden Ring
so many review bombs because the game is hard thats the point its satisfying to overcome the challenge dont buy the game if you just want everything to be easy theres other games for that,Elden Ring
the only role i play in this rpg is the victim,Elden Ring
bro i swear to god how the fuck do you kill the first boss this margit just wont die no matter how many times i try im hours in and i still cant kill this stupid boss,Elden Ring
this game is a modern classic and the dlc is even better the open world reminds me of the original dark souls with a more condensed and layered structure than the base game unique boss fights are tough but fair if you cant beat one youre incentivised to explore every nook and cranny for the upgrade materials new weapon types are fun to use and overall the game looks absolutely stunning would recommend only ask is to please allow native ultrawide support and unlock first person shooter,Elden Ring
h i purchased it to bring it on streaming and im having fun h the character creation is terrible enemies intelligence is bad other things are really good,Elden Ring
its awesome,Elden Ring
beautiful world that trys to kill you,Elden Ring
see a message in front of a wall saying secret lair ahead proceed to roll in to the wall times realise there is no secret room and go about my day,Elden Ring
awesome game,Elden Ring
the best dlc ever made it should be called a old school expansion i can talk about why it is so good and things i think could make the dlc better but i am making this comment to share a fix copy paste from my reddit comment i have a confirmed fix for the performance issues i and my friends had i have not seen this fix on steam nor reddit so far first of all i install new drivers manually and i had no stutter or small freezes which two of my friends had i got curious and installed the new nvidia driver that mentions the dlc specifically and was hoping that it might help me with the consistent lower fpsnot stuttering in very few areas i get and low and behold i started getting stutters after i rolled back to the previous drivers it fixed the issue too long i did not read try rolling back your nvidia drivers confirmed from me and friends i use a lowend rig myself with apls dont judge in it,Elden Ring
sum up elden ring dude why is it that when i flash somebody its like i just slapped them in the face with a fucking napkin from a little kids birthday party but when i get fuckin flashed its like some big brollic black dude named fuckin requis pulls a fucking bedsheet up and around my head and just proceeds to skull fuck me because i spawn die spa spawn die spawn die spawn die spawn die spawn die spawn die spawn die jev,Elden Ring
i recommend the game it wants to solve a little optimization a couple of bugs and its to people who complain about the game being hard i refer you to git gud change the build if you cant kill the boss go the other way explore this game is about exploring and then you can come back stronger,Elden Ring
game is gaming,Elden Ring
best souls game,Elden Ring
game of the decade,Elden Ring
everything is so realistic farm for power helpless against bosses and even ant can kill elephants,Elden Ring
after finishing base game me and my friends was still talking about it years later dlc is perfect and brings me right back to how i felt on my first playthrough this game will always be special to me,Elden Ring
love this game people whinning at the dlc made my week laughing out loud good game,Elden Ring
this is my first ever souls game wish i got into this genre earlier game is an absolute masterpiece and when youre not busy dying you get lost in the deep deep well of lore dlc is just on another level fucking fantastic mate thats for sure,Elden Ring
best game ever unmatched gameplay and level design rise tarnished,Elden Ring
cool as game very fun so many things to do,Elden Ring
best game of the decade,Elden Ring
game of the year game of the decade skill diff dev diff,Elden Ring
a must play game its a great game with immersive exploration diverse build options challenging bossesenemies and a great dlc also the highquality lore adds to its greatness,Elden Ring
i bought the game years ago got hours in and stopped im trying again,Elden Ring
holy shit this is one of the greatest games of all time,Elden Ring
sometimes elden ring is like cock and ball torturebut without the cock and ball,Elden Ring
a little bit difficult but typically speaking a good game,Elden Ring
so many good reviews and yet i have missed the negatives locked first person shooter really no ultrawide support really aaa is this bethesda,Elden Ring
rep melina died l game,Elden Ring
dlc too hard took years off my lifespan would not recommend unless youre looking for an early death,Elden Ring
i was okay with the dlc until i remembered it was,Elden Ring
dlc was great until they buffed the scadutree blessings made the dlc way to easy waste of a dlc not a challenge anymore,Elden Ring
finished achievement slayed all bosses in the game bosses move set is not creative and not fair play just only spam aoeendless chain attack again and again i feel no challenging but only boring also finished sekiro which bosses move set is real creative which i feel fair and challenge,Elden Ring
buyer beware the problem with fromsoft souls games is that hidetaka miyazaki and most of his diehard fan base ignorantly equate frustration and troll mechanics with game difficulty the entire genre is based on getting smacked around by some mob that is tuned like some bully that beats up on ignorant unsuspecting children until they go through enough humiliation and frustration to figure out the attack patterns of said bully its pretty much the same model as the original dragons lair game but obviously with a much more modern format and with behind your back spawns unavoidable jump scare attacks that are often a one shotstun lock till youre dead and mobs whos dodges and attacks are keyed to your inputs all so that you know what not to do next time and achieve a sense of haggard accomplishment as you take steps forward and steps backwards all the way through the game again its not difficult at all despite what some confused people like to brag about its just a frustrating slog until you figure out the patterns then it becomes simple and boring miyazaki is right to say he cant make it less difficult because if you lower the difficulty it would be apparent that this is all there is to the game its perceived difficulty is its selling point im not saying the game doesnt require skill because it definitely does but the skill it requires is simply muscle memory and a whole lot of patience it has to train you to beat the game bit by bit through its one track mechanics once you figure out the patternmeta or you level up enough to just button mash your way though the boss its ugly underbelly is exposed and youre left with a sense of why did i buy this again what was i expecting it certainly wasnt to be trolled by this video games mechanics theres no intuition required as in other games the meta in this game for many is to hope and pray for a lucky break where the proverbial wall youre beating your head against becomes soft where it wasnt the last times you tried it its probably one of the most lame and boring formats in all of gaming history in my opinion heres to hoping that the future will bring us game developers that can actually craft a great game im not holding my breath though rdr is the current apex of gaming and as great as it is even that gameand company have issues with development,Elden Ring
because dlc is garbage last boss in dlc is impossible without specific build killing all fun from making own character,Elden Ring
its honestly laughable how bad this port is despite giving you option to rebind your controls all of the instructions if you can even call them that are based on controller inputs that is itll tell you to press a button on the controller and you need to go into your settings manually to see how the keys line up incredibly lazy and low effort on top of that the game decides to shit itself and corrupt my save with over thirty hours on it deleting all of my progress shitty lazy game do not give these people your money they do not care about pc players,Elden Ring
if you dont get one shot you get two shot in the dlc excelent,Elden Ring
played for hoirs last night save gone shit,Elden Ring
the shadow of the erdtree dlc broke the optimization unplayable frame drops at the moment dont get this dlc until a fix is found or fromsoft fixes it,Elden Ring
the game itself is a masterpiece i have only one problem with elden ring and its a problem that sadly really ruined my experience of this great game the game optimization is awful i have a and have constant first person shooter drops to or in p but even in p although its a bit better its especially bad with a game like elden ring where frames are important gameplay wise i hope the devs will make improvements on optimization and perhaps at least ad options like dlss,Elden Ring
blandest game in the franchise and arguably the genre as a whole woefully unbalanced abusable combat endlessly repeating bosses and hundreds of cloned dungeons open world with the only reward for curiosity and exploration being more monotony i think its a real shame fromsoft went in this direction genuinely sububisoft levels of creativity on display more often than not if you enjoy the game im glad for you but i would rather play anything in their back catalogue,Elden Ring
darksouls clone with too many rollspam bosses,Elden Ring
worst dlc ever i swear dark souls better than this piece of shit thanks for elden ring but the dlc fucked the game,Elden Ring
nope not recommending it i mean sure if you like dying times on single mob or boss then yea this game is for you other than that it has great graphics fx and so on but the combat the waiting for the perfect spot and not coming until minutes well this shit is not for me too bad i cant refund it,Elden Ring
worked fine before dlc now whenever i try to load up the game easy anticheat gets to briefly tries to initialize then dies cant play the game i paid for tried numerous fixes and nothing works,Elden Ring
pc port is completely broken low framerate on an i on minimum settings x resolution recommend purchase on console instead,Elden Ring
had the golden formula ruined it with open world exploration and making the game easier than its predecessors to get a wider market the games empty space with nothing in it no direction and the most copy paste in any souls game,Elden Ring
only time ive enjoyed this game is the feeling you get for a short minutes after you defeat a boss badly designed game not deserve goty cool graphics would rather play a well designed s game than any soulslike sims better the escapists better fall guys better isis beheading videos more entertaining than this dogshit bosses are just rinse and repeat would rather be subjected to hours of waterboarding than play hours straight of this game good games shouldnt have to be played with guides just sayin,Elden Ring
game is really pretty but feels unfinished for pc tons of issues with ui and controls that still arent fixed in the dlc if anything they made more ui issues and more camera issues most new content is just annoying camera problems and ui problems to distract from the fact the the only gameplay mechanic is timing your rolls,Elden Ring
if you are sensitive to light do not get this the final boss of the dlc will at best give you a migraine i dont think itll be possible for me to even attempt a fight long enough to actually win with all the light flashes flying everywhere,Elden Ring
the dlc seems great but performance is terrible after spending a lot of time adjusting the setting to get decent first person shooter i started to get random freezes for several seconds in many locations it totally ruins the experience and no clear solution is found anywhere,Elden Ring
you get banned for using the in game summon system,Elden Ring
the game is actually great and would like to give a good review however the performance is terrible no matter the settings the game runs badly i play this on the same hardware that yields + first person shooter on path tracing cyberpunk and alan wake both games feel a generation ahead of er in graphics quality and use actually modern cutting edge techelden ring doesnt it has great design but not technically demanding graphics the fact that fromsoft has done almost nothing in years to address this is annoying i have hrs on postscript and can barely manage on pc and thats saying a lot considering how poorly optimized the consoles version is,Elden Ring
stop complaining about the difficulty of the game the problem with the game isnt that its difficult its that the combat design is crap v rising brutal mode is a difficult game i spent hours fighting adam on malenia i spent hours without a single cheeze and malenias combat design is rubbish while adams combat design is fucking awesome malenias waterfall is impossible to figure out where to hit box damage in phase another attack like that is added the whole difficulty of which is that you cant see where or how the damage will be dealt the boss just jumps on your screen throwing various hit box damage to which you have only one answer the dodge button of course you can throw a freeze bomb at it you can summon a mimic friend brother letmysoloher and so on but none of that cancels out the bad design in v rising i didnt need any guides or help from friends just honest reactions and knowledge of mechanics that the game doesnt hide from you,Elden Ring
ubase gameu outdated and obtuse but serviceable combat within a very detailed and pretty hellscape decent game for everyone that i would recommend udlcu unreasonable combat that clashes with its already outdated mechanics but its an even prettier hell of a world the dlc is not something id recommend to most people i liken the elden ring experience to eating a spicy dish fromsoftwares games have always been a bit obtuse and just like spicy food its not really for everyone so its a bit of delight when they get so much recognition they make good curry the base elden ring game is a bit of a foray into newness for them because they havent ever made a world this big yet and that comes with advantages and disadvantages for one the world its set in is gorgeous and fun to really just traverse in that however means theres a whole bunch of empty space not occupied by corridors and enemies it also extends the amount of time for a single run for the average player which depending on who you are is a good or a bad thing overall i think the game has really good presentation thanks to its visual language its visages the music that flows between ambient and bombastic when needed and just the strange and mysterious elements that fascinate a lot of their audience the dlc is all of these things and more and thats not necessarily a good thing just like how its not always a good thing to make a dish spicier the expansion adds a whole new map thats a bit more compact but it shares a lot of the same characteristics of the base game its really pretty and i like how a lot of enemies and architecture that just juxtapose itself with that of the base game the story that unfolds uncovers a few of the things that never really got an explanation at all and you meet characters are much more likeable albeit their brief appearances whats absolutely unacceptable is their decision to make combat so unbalanced and nonsensical the base game occasionally has issues where enemies would just spin on the spot and hit you and that unintuitive and silly implementation is everywhere in the expansion they also have been entertaining this obtuse way of breaking peoples reflexive response by delaying attacks in awkward ways and its excruciating egregious in the dlc on top of that they decided tough enemies should just attack endlessly without any good indicators of when their attacks end they basically broke every rule of a real time combat game and instead of making them some pioneer into the genre it makes elden rings combat unreasonable the dlc exacerbates this problem instead of solving it and that alone makes me incapable of recommending this to anyone despite how much i love the rest of the game i think fromsoft cooked a bit too hard this time around,Elden Ring
played this game for hours to get a single item to upgrade one item once to which no noticeable difference is made and not for one second did i even have fun on the arduous journey just continuous bosses who are designed to defy the games own concept of combat if you want fun its not this game if you want to spend hours of your life having a headache and having thoughtsactions of damaging your own property this is for you and after playing this game for hours i can say the only concept of joy you may get from this game is beating a boss who has been destroying you for the past hours and its really not even joy its more like relief after being constipated for a week and finally blowing your sh painful but thank god its over,Elden Ring
eldenring feels like the easier dark souls which gives you an open world map to explore where you will have no clue who you are what you are doing what is going on or where you are supposed to go the story is lacking really hard and is boring as expected there are some mods which can definetly increase the fun by a lot namely seemless coop and carian combo warriors without mods it feels just off and boring as hell verdict way to easy,Elden Ring
before dlc best game ive ever played sunk hundreds of hours in and never slowed down for months and would always come back for more too long i did not read the greatest dlc yet is the reason im quitting elden ring unless its fixed after dlc now im in ng+ and the dlc is so unplayable after spending about hours now ive managed to defeat bossesmind you the play style is so disengaging theres no reward for the kill sometime inbetween dying to each boss times i spent about hours aimlessly searching for scadutree shards only to find out i still get shot with bullgoat armorbest in game this dlc has been a total flop for me a waste of time and money at least until theres a way to reset the ng+ health and damage multipliers,Elden Ring
fix your fuckin hit boxes in gaius god damn shits ridiculous he just corner traps you in the beginning and you cant just not get hit,Elden Ring
game is too easy,Elden Ring
if this is the direction theyre gonna go they need to trim a lot of fat leftover from when the game was about adventure and not exclusively rolling,Elden Ring
charging for a game that still stutters since its launch renders this otherwise enjoyable game unplayable despite trying various solutions including mods and disabling hardware on my computer the games frame rate drops from its locked first person shooter to half that every few seconds without any apparent cause it baffles me that my flawless experience with this game on the postscript contrasts sharply with the pc version unfortunately due to fromsoftwares inability to address these glaring issues i must request a refund rather than focusing on negative reviews related to the games difficulty i urge attention to those discussing the persistent stuttering a quick google search reveals numerous threads and articles highlighting this issue yet no concrete fix exists,Elden Ring
it doesnt have a sustainable multiplayer mode bad game design its impossible to play with friends when the griefing is nonstop it looks pretty poor on the games developers when there are rd party developers making better mods that make coop seamless and customizable theyre the ones carrying this game if you intend to play with friends i dont care how great a game this is as a solo experience this game still shows a major weakness and isnt worth its price tag when mods are needed to fix glaring issues that prevent players from actually playing stars for the seamless coop mod and the developer go support them trying to play this with friends but its trash atm and we cant wait for the heavylifting mods to fix this game,Elden Ring
dlc is beautiful but the enemies deal absurd damage and the bosses are non stop hyper aggresive pieces of shit with no regard to stamina ever after scadutree blessing they shot you in ng+ lvl maybe if you enjoy casters and magics and play from afar only dodging from time to time is the intended way to play hard enemies dont stagger unless you play with the heaviest of weapons and bonk your way,Elden Ring
i enjoyed it for quite awhile in spite of the open world design but it eventually got too annoying and repetitive for me,Elden Ring
i love this game but after soe came out i am unable to launch this game without my computer blue screening its simply unacceptable and will change if its fixed honestly its already taken too long,Elden Ring
beat the dlc and the femboy didnt even give me a foot job mediocre,Elden Ring
this is a dive roll simulator with nice graphics the lorerole playing elements dont even amount to a cogent story let alone something more compelling it reminds one of the worst bit games of the past where you must simply memorize massive move sets and then rely on button timing it is joyless aside from the often stunning visuals given its reputation along with other from games i gave it plenty of time and took part in the repetitive grinding to git gud but found no satisfaction in the end this is gaming masochism which is probably a compliment for the super fans,Elden Ring
first person shooter issue fuck anticheat and first person shooter limit,Elden Ring
if they dont fix the crashing on pc after the v patch im finna gunna tryina lose my shiiiiiet,Elden Ring
commander niall and the godskin duo are the most unfair bosses oat horrible game will still play it though its like an abusive husband,Elden Ring
meh demon souls and dark souls are the better games of the series,Elden Ring
game is ass,Elden Ring
the keybinds feel terrible clearly this is a controller or dont bother style of gaming,Elden Ring
literally a garbage game nothing about it is fun every boss is lame dont waste you money on this garbage,Elden Ring
worst fromsoft game by far easiest if you abuse all the stupid op magic but if you play melee only by far the hardest game they ever made because of all the unfair and bullshit attacks just go buy dark souls its so much better,Elden Ring
nah fuck this game ive tried so hard to appreciate it im debating even fucking with the dlc because at this point who cares whats the allure of difficulty and challenge when bosses get basically unlimited stamina because yknow i really love roll roll roll roll roll hit roll roll roll roll roll roll hit riveting gameplay truly fire giant is so fucking stupid an intentionally draggedout bossfight because cinema or something i love doing barely any damage with a heavy greatsword on a strength build and then getting one shot by his stupid fucking shield after waving at his leg for minutes fucking utterly ridiculous,Elden Ring
this game could very well be what tlou is to naughty dog consider this game lucky for not being technically categorized as a sequel despite it belonging to an outstanding genre with its main attractiveness and majority of the content rendered disappointing in elden ring by poor rpg stats balancing a very minor problem in this genre albeit magnified by an absent of progression pacing the fine and tailored experience through a fixed difficulty which from software catered to players in previous titles no longer defines this game this shift has led to a dilution of the tightly controlled difficulty curve that was a hallmark of from softwares previous titles the sense of accomplishment from overcoming meticulously designed obstacles is somewhat lost amidst the vast and sometimes uneven landscape of elden ring,Elden Ring
the game is broken for me now with the new dlc the performance has gone done the drain in a big way even though i have a far better card now until this is fixed i have to recommend against it the game itself is great but with how precise you need to be getting massive frame drops is a definite no no,Elden Ring
dlc sucks they ampted up the enemies to the point you have to respect your character for every boss fight plus added extreme aggro so you cant get a break at any point plus added enemies that are immune to damage except when you parry them perfectly parry is only available on certain shields not the same game that got initially released only play if you want to hate your life or want to feel like your beating your head against a wall,Elden Ring
i would but it would just be chalked up to get better,Elden Ring
incredible art design cinematic battle scenes and worst fighting experience since dark souls even worse than the stupid bed of chaos yes i can defeat bosses with allies and the right build but whats the point of this are you trying to teach me how to play this game why cant i defeat them alone by rolling and swinging my favorite greatswords in dark souls you can usually attack a boss after hit combos midirs and gwyns hit combos are like exceptions but in this dlc they never stop and you die in hits with vigor and greatshield talisman men are you serious,Elden Ring
one of the worst controls in gaming,Elden Ring
fuck this game,Elden Ring
this game is dogshit it is grinding sim after the first playthrough it is an actual chore to play wouldnt reccommend the dlc sucks dick too,Elden Ring
what were the devs thikig when making this dlc how much weed was smoked how much coke was shorted i got to renella and let me tell you her ballsack move where she flyes in the air is just ridiculous im doging and rolling and yet the impact of her balls hitting the ground is just too much that my character groans in agony at the bullshit that is renala dlc,Elden Ring
best game ever but no ultrawide support beyond ridiculous,Elden Ring
base game is good dlc is trash,Elden Ring
this game is not fun nor has it ever been fun for me i strongly dislike soulsborne games and they will never be anything but frustration and upset for me fuck this game,Elden Ring
she died,Elden Ring
shitty hitboxes inflated damage numbers lazy design yet its praised crazy,Elden Ring
i hate easy anti cheat right now all its doing is searching for the most random file and then using it as a excuse to put me in offline mode so i can get help from others to beat a dlc boss and its so unbalanced in the dlc,Elden Ring
game bad,Elden Ring
fix your game with the expac it keeps saying inappropriate activity detected and kicking us from the game i has happened to people so far in our server and we have nothing added to do such a thing on top of the fact we validated our game files and restarted our pcs and games,Elden Ring
i adored this game then the dlc launched and despite me not owning it the general patch released alongside it has led to frequent first person shooter drops that makes the game somewhere between unpleasant and unplayable i have no opinion on sote i do have an opinion on having a great game then having it essentially made unplayable due to ineptitude and lack of testing shame,Elden Ring
== so since shadow of the eardtree for some odd reason has no leave review button window anything on its page im leaving this in here until that section is fixed and i can properly migrate it to the dlc == and before you read this im not a hardcore fromsoft player im a super casual player who really enjoyed er and loved the difficulty level there summons and all that included elden ring was the nd fromsoft game i really fell in love with after sekiro it was just right up my alley not too ridiculously difficult but not a slouch either amazing open world mechanics everything so i thought man what a blast a dlc to one of the most enjoyable games ive played yeah no first credit where credit is due music art style new weapons bloody awesome the spamage of chonky enemies who by the way are trash enemies apparently that decimate your horsepower like they are a boss not so much yes it gets a lil less ridiculous when you get the scadu fragments but bosses laughing out loud reminds me of what blizzard did at one point we are out of cool ideas so lets just spam as many abilities as frantically as possible at the player yeah no every bosss now has a ridiculous amount of fking arena wide skills that legit make your camera go fking bonkers lot sof them for some reason have some sort of fking hellicoptah moves that have so much special effects you cant even tell whats going on and thent heres the fking dragon that dragon that only has targetable point and its the head and for some reason even if youre right under it you fking miss your swings because your character is literally too short honest to god one of the worst fight ive had in my entire er carrier granted the spectable is amazing the fight itself is a nightmare for a casualplayer all in all im not enjoying the dlc at all looks nice sounds nice plays bloody awful all around if you love frustration and wasting your time you can safely get the dlc but its a very different experience from the base game and i simply cannot say that its like the base game or better sadly no right now im just trying to finish ti for the sake of finishing it and i will probably never touch er again this has soured my experience so much im pretty much done with it i dont mind difficulty but most of the boss fights here are just not fun and then theres the performance issues been having a ridiculous amount of first person shooter issues and still no ultrawide laughing out loud yeah anyway back to the slog,Elden Ring
clunky controls cringe story waste of time,Elden Ring
lost of my grace sites for no reason when loading the game,Elden Ring
this shit blows hours in and the tree sentinel is still beating my ass its dumb that they expect you to win when the game is objectively impossible braindead developers and a braindead game,Elden Ring
finally beat the first dragon just to be teleported by a chest and lose all my runes,Elden Ring
console port locked to first person shooter effort for pc version of the game no working multiplayer solid,Elden Ring
this game is shit with + hours played i am am speaking from experience when i say i extremely recommend not purchasing this video game this game will leave you in tears and not happy tears very very sad tears especially the downloadable content unless you are a demon next if you want to lose countless hours of sleep or waste many hours of your life simply hating it then this is the game for you honorable mention oppositions include any canine being andor and flying animals,Elden Ring
no ultrawide support first person shooter limit in other games would be lynched for something like that,Elden Ring
since dlc update game massively lagging for me but what i see in videos is great,Elden Ring
hours played ~ dlc stutters of the time inappropriate activity detected me playing apparently story as elusive as my social life gameplay fighting hard opponents for no reasonkind of like my real life but with more dragons conclusion spent + on frustration and a fancy error message would uninstall again,Elden Ring
are you serious first i get inappropriate behaviour detected meaning i cant play online when im completely unaware how to even behave inappropriately and now it just hard crashes my steam deck great game but the anticheat is abysmal beyond broken,Elden Ring
after update i get the message saying something bad is detected and prevents me from playing online i reinstalled and did the file check thing suggested nothings working steam deck my pc works fine but still aint cool so far they havent fixed just said to do what i stated above kinda ridiculous,Elden Ring
absolutely unplayable i have an rtx and playing with everything set to low im getting the worst frame drops and performance ive ever seen from a game like this i zoom in with a bow and my frames drop to not even able to keep a steady first person shooter my cpu gets way too warm also i would recommend this game if i could play it hoping for a patch,Elden Ring
oneshot mechanics and a blunt increase in damage in the dlc are the most incompetent and simple thing you can think of git good you need to clean with your tongue the whole fucking map to reduce the damage show me a game where you have to completely finish the game and dig into the ass of the creator to get access to the dlc and pass it normally old hunters the ringed city werent that hard no more fucking preorders git good they adjusted the damage and everybody are happy to get a load of shit and swallow it,Elden Ring
im too old for this shit i just want to explore the world and try out the cool spells im getting really tired of the all souls games must be pure pain formula i played through dark souls multiple times with multiple builds i also played through sekiro and many soulslikes made by other studios the surge lords of the fallen and many others im fucking done banging my head against the wall for hours on a single boss i have work tomorrow many will call me a scrub and tell me to git gud and you know what yes aging made me shit i dont care anymore its pretty pathetic of you though that the only bragging worthy achievement you have in life is beating a hard game,Elden Ring
fix some bug first before launching dlc,Elden Ring
consistent first person shooter before the update down to under and stuttering after pls fix edit the anticheat doesnt like the program sizer closing it has my first person shooter back up to bwe love invasive anticheat softwareb,Elden Ring
i want ^³^ to wike this game but its just too >< hawd i cant beat any of the bosses and my fwiends just teww me to get good ><,Elden Ring
its tough to critique this game and find grounds upon which i can convey what you want to convey do i think this game is worth trying i do but i thing it is past over rated to its own detriment because i know fromsoft might have tweaked some things if the audience actually cared to discuss the issues instead of thinking of themselves as hardcore gamers for defeating the game elden ring feels to me like a food that you really enjoy at first with mild issues you realize the flavor becomes too strong after a couple chews and that it has some annoying bones or that it makes some noises when you cut it with a knife but its negligible since the food is so delicious but as you get familiarized with the food you realize the strong flavor the bones and the noises make up too much of the experience for you to really enjoy the delicious part of it elden ring is a good time at a wide angle and yet has so many small disturbances that the experience goes past bitter straight to the point the game hardly teaches you how to enjoy it and wandering around leads to disgusting experiences some casual enemies have way too much life and they respawn so they game can easily turn into grind fest the enemies that are not like that might as well be the absolute opposite and you just blow them instantly or run past them these are mild annoyances that amount to too much of the experience for it to feel good if you play some specific builds like strfai like dex like int and a couple others the game is perfectly fine the experience feels tailored and most bosses will at first be enjoyable but even with said builds a lot of encounters take so much time that you eventually get burned out this happens because a lot of factors margit for example attacks way too much radahn has an annoying size and giant confusing hitboxes rennala is poking you while summoning shi all of these fights have long times in between either because of the long attack patterns or because the boss is making distance so you have to get close without carelessly getting open to an attack and then you attack and the boss happens to have super armor in its vulnerable moments thats the thing about games where you are expected to die shouldnt the game feel designed for replayability but this game isnt its mostly focused on the show aspect of it all also some attacks are really uncomfortable and if you get the short end of the stick you might get said move over and over again to where other people will say that fight was easy but they got the easiest attack pattern the game has almost none spectrum between piss easy and hard when it comes to those key fights i could summon in commander neill and it was still hard but better than before but when you summon against mohg it all goes down the drain either the summon is really good and can take him practically alone or youre still dead because theres an attack you cant dodge in my opinion a lot of bosses have too much horsepower and dmg for no reason like you realize the experience wouldnt have suffered if they werent so pumped quite the opposite like theres so much i have to say because this game has a lot of small issues that amount to a big dookie the game is worth playing but it gets annoying and tedious too much for it to feel worth it,Elden Ring
having loved elden ring and the souls series before it ive finally hit my wall this is for me not fun at all why because the challenge is unrelentingly brutal having upgrades to help you survive in the world is a cool thing it encourages you to search around and scrap by harking back to ones first time playing a prior souls game though instead of souls or equipment its an item that increases your stats by a percentage and one that buffs summons the problem is even in your s and with some of these items many early game bosses will kill you in too hits anyway i know try hards will tell you using summons or tears is for weak peepee babies but one of the two new upgrades is specifically for this so it seems to expect players to lean on them speaking of bosses the part i like the most are the worst part they are obscenely aggressive so spell casting is super difficult as you are bound to eat an attack for posterity im not just talking about one boss all ive faced so far have been like this on top of that half of them have an insane amount of health so these fights become an endurance test many people love to talk about you need to learn the bosses and get good but even when you do learn them one screw up and you gotta do it all over again when you finally do beat one you dont get that felling of pride when finally winning instead you get neurotic about finding more of that dlc leveling item so you can get creamed for hours all over again with some other boss i truly wish i could get a refund for this,Elden Ring
dlc as in kill urself if you think of the bosses in this dlc are even remotely good commander giaus,Elden Ring
shitty console port of a mediocre af game performance is laughably bad and so are the controls the coop is also way behind modern standards for a triple a game developers do better,Elden Ring
my save has been corrupted twice not early game saves not mediocre end game after completing everything in the gametwo times over im back to square one and am done this is a fantastic game with fucking horrid tech behind it when the game first launched it rans terribly now with the dlc releasing its stuttering constantly again ive got a fucking and it cant deal with this fucking game will try again after a few years when modders have fixed from softwares issues,Elden Ring
open world slop basically a ubisoft game,Elden Ring
i hate this game,Elden Ring
this review is for the base game without the dlc so i have spent over h in elden ring across several vanilla playtroughs and several avalible overhauls convergence reforged and maybe even more i do not know given my time spent in elden ring it may be unusual that i am leaving it a negative review or to be more precise i am not recommending the game thats how steam contextualizes these reviews when i first played elden ring the experience with the game was excellent at the time only other open world arpgs that ive played were bethesda games and ubisoftubislop which elden ring even at its worst exceeds in quality after playing elden ring i finished for the first time previous fromsoft titles dark souls and sekiro which i liked a lot now that the dlc for elden ring has released i wanted to level a brand new character for the dlc replaying elden ring with other fromsoft games fresh in the mind i realized just how bloated and empty the game feels compared to previously mentioned fromsoft games and that with elden ring fromsoft has really prioritized quantity over quality which is the opposite of their previous work open world aspect that was added in elden ring adds pretty vistas and visuals at the tradeoff that the world is tedious to navigate most dissapointing are the packs of trash mobs in the overworld which walk around as if the game was some shitty mmo or god forbid ubislop and not a delibarate hand made experience it was easy to recommend elden ring when ubislop games were the control that i was comparing the game to but it does not compare well to previous games such as dark souls and sekiro if you are a new player that has not played any fromsoft titles before i would highly recommend dark souls and sekiro over elden ring as they provide more compact and quality focused experiences i would recommend elden ring only if you really liked what those older fromsoft titles offered and want more but be ready for a watered down experience which focuses more on quantity over quality,Elden Ring
the game keeps crashing every min,Elden Ring
since the latest patch i can load or play this game i dont know what has happened but its broke even tried reinstalling it dont waste your money,Elden Ring
i know they say that this game is great that you just need to wait for it to click with you but the truth is there will always always be a chance that this game will never click with you its sad that some people just choose to ignore this fact i hate souls games all of them,Elden Ring
playing this on pc is a fucking nightmare the setting is useless,Elden Ring
shit is for real mad dog shit but people gassed it think about it you are learning a pattern that doesnt apply to anything else in your life as a human you should beat the boss given time therefore there should not be any satisfaction in it cuz you should know and you should believe that you are better than the humanly designed pattern dlc made every boss on crack really was wondering when i got to attack worst thing ever made but people gassed it like its the best laugh my ass off,Elden Ring
doing my part in letting people know to not buy this garbage for bucks dlc has absolute dogshit boss design artificial difficulty never felt that bored playing a souls game before,Elden Ring
and i need to search for rd party fixes for ultra wide support and it will also ban me from online play absurd,Elden Ring
too long i did not read no ultrawide support its a fun game if youre on a monitor there is nothing bad to say one of my most played games on steam that being said i upgraded my monitor to this past year im just learning elden ring doesnt natively support ultrawide resolutions im forced to play or play offline in with mods so if you want to play in pirate the game you wont get online features anyway,Elden Ring
elden ring is a perverse game for perverse people perverse comes from latin pervertere to turn back dark souls was an amazing game because it was different the mechanics of the game served immersion and the theme of the game the themes of the game include despair futility anxiety hopelessness and so on you get the picture the world is dying and full of dead people trying to avoid their fate of turning hollow the game was so original and immersive that people loved it but there was a misunderstanding it became a meme and the salespitch was that the game is hard but being hard was not the point the point was the experience of which being hard was a part of the experience is so impact that people want to relive dark souls but you cant relive it you already had the experience and you can try to cling on to it as i tried and countless people try so when fromsoft came out with a more refined pretty openworld dark souls people were hypnotized by the promise everyone wants to love it so they will the game to be good but they dont notice that their want for the game to be good is the only thing that makes the game good elden ring is trying to be dark souls ds was hard so elden ring is more hard ds had a lot of bosses so er has more bosses ds had obtuse quests so er has even more obtuse quests but when a game is trying to be a previous version of itself but better it fails to be itself because it is trying to dark souls was creative and took risks but trying to simulate ds is not creative or risky its safe and predictable dark souls was already trying too hard to be ds elden ring has the mechanics of dark souls with a few small additions but ds was already pushing the limited mechanics with just making the bosses have longer combos and more awkward timings so elden ring is hard by giving bosses even longer combos with more awkward timings there is nothing new in the gameplay or game design of the enemies and bosses have existed in some form in a previous game you deal with every boss the same way you dodge times and hit the boss times repeat it is the same gameplay loop as every souls game but doing the same thing for years gets stale people know that the combat is stale but they are hypnotized by the illusion of a magnificent game the new dark souls people want to cling on to the past so they lie to themselves that they are having a good time but the only fun in the game is working for some goal you want the next weapon you want to see the next boss but when you have discovered most of the game you might notice that you are just doing the same repetitive tasks fighting the same repetitive bosses you have some hope that there comes some moment that validates the whole experience but it never comes the real challenge of elden ring is to see past the illusion notice that you cannot reexperience dark souls and abandon trying to then stop playing orient yourself to the future and not the past go to the unknown and do something new instead of clinging on to year old mechanics to fight bosses over and over again doing the same thing its just so futile creativity is doing something new going into the unkown future taking risks elden ring is clinging on to the past making players cling to the past just to sell you the same thing its just so frustrating and futile,Elden Ring
cant play because of all the messages and blood stains its annoying and boring,Elden Ring
performance issues and random crashes since the dlc has launched cant give it a positive review while it has technical issues like this,Elden Ring
worst souls game,Elden Ring
im sorry but when it rains days and rain makes enemies invisible and also ruin your performance its horrible remove rain im sick of seeing milk strings fall from the sky ruining my performance by first person shooter i play at first person shooter normally so its literally unplayable,Elden Ring
as long as the dlc weapons in base game invasion exist i would not recoment playing online,Elden Ring
cant believe i never wrote a review originally oh well miyazaki is washed the game starts amazing but by the back end it becomes unfairly difficult getting killed in hits is not fun no souls game has ever done that before and its a pretty awful time i also had been saying since launch that they clearly forgot to enable letting you use your horse during the final boss and were too embarrassed to add it back in too early when it would cause a pr stink well now they finally added it back in which gives credibility to my criticisms of the game fights like the godskin duo try to recapture the magic of what ornstein smough did years prior they recaptured the thunderous roar of that fight as a short wet fart its dark souls logic what if we add multiple enemies to the encounter thatll make it harder and please the toxic pissbabies who let us hide behind them from all criticism right only this time miyazaki doesnt have a b team to push the blame on real gamers­ constantly criticize rockstar games linear game design that requires you to do one specific thing to win why are we treating godskin duo like they arent also like that essentially the two bosses in the fight have their own individual health bars and one big health bar that they share once the shared health bar depletes to zero the fight ends however this does not mathematically correlate to their individual health bars they will both die numerous times throughout this fight and then respawn were fromsoftware still the genius avantgarde game devs they once were nigh over a decade ago they would have made it so that depleting both of their health bars within a small window would prematurely end the fight as one could not resurrect the other but nope i aint even getting into the fact that everything after leyndell is a bland artificially difficult sadistic piece of trash all ill say is they should have cut out everything that comes after leyndell save for the haligtree farum azula and the final boss it would have been a much much better game were that the case and it would have been able to be about in too and have saved a lot of development time elden ring is too big and too ambitious for its own good it has many redeeming factors particularly in its first half its art design and its lore but the flaws make for a truly insufferable experience that is beloved by the worst most obnoxious person with a superiority complex that you know the real fromsoft fans yearn for chromehounds and armored core,Elden Ring
no ultrawide support in is a no go the game itself is descent but not as good as dark souls,Elden Ring
a game for people who like anime and have hamster wheels for brains enjoy your rollslop chuddie,Elden Ring
teh most disgusting bosses live ever seen i beg you to do something to fix this its impossible to dodge this finale boss,Elden Ring
the game is good but constant black screen with only mouse tried all fixes that i could find online,Elden Ring
the dlc has preformance issues,Elden Ring
lvl got stuck on godskin apostle in the divine tower of caelid i refuse to leave and level up or grind more runes strength and faith builds are ass boss too difficult aka game too hardbad bosss moveset is too janky itll hit you when it shouldnt cant wait to play the dlc hopefully they have learned,Elden Ring
the dlc is just bullshit the bosses are just not fun anymore i beaten most of the other fromsoft games but this is where my line is,Elden Ring
this shit is ass,Elden Ring
this game is locked at first person shooter so the developers dont give a crap about the pc port next the game is not for casual players this game is ass,Elden Ring
dull repetitive waste of time its whatever there are better games to spend money on,Elden Ring
honestly i have to say from software is one of the best studios in the game industry at art animation and atmosphere however the gameplay has been the almost the exact same for their games for over a decade sekiro was a huge step in the right direction rewarding a more aggressive inyourface playstyle and an actually fleshed out narrative instead this game is the same roll and light attack spam fest as it was in dark souls bloodborne encouraged an aggressive playstyle as well frankly this game feels a lot like ds instead of a new game and it shows with a lot of the same reused animations and enemies making the game open world only exacerbates this problem and highlights the monotonous combat further as the gameplay loop is pretty much the same thing the whole time and this is a long game there is a huge imbalance in the weapons and as you get later in the game you tend to rely on the same weapons with the same movesets in order to deal with damage sponges the bosses in this game and especially the dlc arent as fun as it could be as you are almost always forced to be on the defensive and play reactively the whole time i only wish they put as much effort in the players moveset as the bosses i hope from software reinvents their gameplay as the ds style combat is now dated in my opinion,Elden Ring
die to boss wth players to the point the game gave me a ban online fr thnkx messmer or wat ever,Elden Ring
playing this dlc is a torture,Elden Ring
another bad pc port constantly stuttering during fights in a game where timing is everything it makes it basically unplayable most recently though ill get frozen mediocre animation drinking a potion and can slide around like a statue but cannot attack or interact with anything have to either get killed or restart can not recommend based on the current state,Elden Ring
the stuttering i have encountered in this game is actually disgusting fix yo game,Elden Ring
unfairly difficult its been hours and ive been stuck on margit i dont know how much longer i can put my foolish ambitions to rest,Elden Ring
do you want your base game to stutter do you want to be shown that all the unbalanced parts of vanilla were not mistakes but an intentional way to pad out playtime do you want to search for mcguffins but not be told thats what you need then this dlc is for you but if you dont like being abused and like a game company that respects you and your time then pass up on this one,Elden Ring
messmer needs to be fixed,Elden Ring
for the life of me i cannot get this game to have anything but a black screen or an infinite loading screen on character creation where avatar does not even appear and the latter happens only if im lucky ive waited for literal hours on my computer while i slept as per game time to see if game actually gets past loading screen or black screen but it just never happens will change review if either a fromsoftware fixes this b i somehow do,Elden Ring
game is shit play it and question me,Elden Ring
not much to do after getting all the achievements,Elden Ring
er is in a weird place the combat was never finished but it has its dick riders so there will never be progress to fix it amazing exploration the first time around as youd expect bosses are cool the feeling is amazing that everywhere you go is going to have its dangers performance is an issue the game stutters on pc but what do you expect from sony they want you to buy their overpriced console theyll make their own product worse to sell a quick buck combat just isnt done makes the game super difficult to recommend when of interacting with the game is done through a combat system that makes no sense and is just broken its not a hard combat system its just not well designed need updates as soon as possible but thats not happening,Elden Ring
i dont recommend playing elden ring it is extremely boring game the skill of the game is to spam dodges blocks and sometimes attack i havent received any fun playing this game wasted money,Elden Ring
overrated,Elden Ring
this game stutters more than a stroke patient going miles per hour down a dirt road while singing bohemian rhapsody and it has been three years mister michael zaki,Elden Ring
needs a lot of work done to be honest,Elden Ring
i kind of hate this game the armor looks cool so do the weapons the controls are awful and crampy the camera sucks and is intentionally too slow and then slaps around on edges the random lag is annoying the input lag is annoying i really wanted to like this game and i finished all the achievements but the total lack of the laws of physics on some things and the complete enforcement on others is just goofy like seriously just a long spear to the neck,Elden Ring
a game made for controllers if you play on the keyboard you will start to feel suicidal you have to watch tutorials on how to play this game and how to build your character and i dont know why they didnt include watch mojo tutorials seen no one will explain to you how to progress in this game game my ass go take some good mecanics from doom eternal fuck you i will see you tomorrow,Elden Ring
this dlc is a huge step backwards i feel like im dealing with the same artifical difficulty that was put into dark souls two unresponsive controls make combat nearly impossible it makes zero sense that something half your size can juggernaught through all your attacks heavies included to make things worse the bosses arent even that much harder more than the dev just hid endless attack stings behind over the top animations that have you seeing more effects than actual gameplay then you have the new system of finding collectibles to gain power which i understand why you players exploring but this system totally killed the post game as none of it matters that is not a smart decision and needs to be reviewed in the next dlc i get what from software was trying to do but this isnt it they need to take it back to how vanilla was it was fun to play but challenging enough to make the victories worth it now i feel like im just catching lucky breaks or cheesing the fight in summary hidetaka miyazakis over the top need to make the game hard is ruining a good thing he needs to understand that making a game hard and making a game have cheap mechanics are two different things you can have difficulty without the clear need to hinder everything about how you play the game dmc monster hunter i could go one,Elden Ring
a thoroughly unenjoyable game that i wish to get my back from with this i will abstain from providing fromsoftware any more money and will not support the continuation of their products,Elden Ring
this game is fucking dunmb,Elden Ring
im going to kms,Elden Ring
literally impossible,Elden Ring
i do not have to justify my view that the dlc simply is not fun but i will the world is structured intentionally to obfuscate most not a few of the location of the areas this results in general confusion im often riding in circles not getting anywhere until i pull up a guide online the bosses are simply designed to be frustrating they are not fun to play against i am just sitting and waiting to have my turn to attack for a couple minutes the saying that you die in dark souls because you run out of estus flasks but you die in elden ring and much more so here because you get hit once in the middle of a combo move is absolutely true examples mesmer just glides across half of the length of the arena to kill you in one stab he also has many similiar looking moves that are just frustrating and boring to try to dodge his snake forms have junk hit boxes as does another hog riding boss and the final boss is some kind of cruel joke the move set is unfair and the rays of light obfuscate the screen to the point that i cant even see whats going on i just do not see how this got past play testing its like they didnt even play the bosses they were making there are also a great deal of mechanical issues frame rate stuttering amongst others that would not be acceptable for any game kind of unbelievable that it launched in this state i have a dollar gaming pc i simply cannot recommend the dlc i very much enjoyed the base game and would recommend that anyone who has purchased the base game stick to that if you absolutely need to purchase the dlc wait a couple years until its on sale by then they should have fixed the mechanical issues and nerfed all of the bosses to a point where they are enjoyable to fight finally i was not going to write this review because i normally dont but the fact that so many people are hating on people who negatively review the dlc because of these problems compelled me to put out my honest opinion rather than pretend to enjoy this bad game dlc,Elden Ring
i was excited for to conquer the shadow realm and the hardest boss was the lord of quicksand that would drag me into the floor and out of the map countless times did i perish over and overgame runs as fast as a paraplegic i used my strongest weapon to defeat this boos the refund button and now my character will remain stuck in the shadow realm forever,Elden Ring
once they fix the inappropriate activity detected bug with the newest update ill change my review,Elden Ring
game is fun i have no problem with the difficulty of new dlc but the performance is worse than cyberpunks when it launched the games optimisation was fine whyd you have to go and fuck it up is it that hard to keep something working properly imagine what life could be if the devs actually played their own game and saw the fuckups even call of dutys devs are making fun of you mcdonalds ice cream machine is more reliable than devs these days its and the last good game was witcher julle almal se poes,Elden Ring
ive been playing for a little while but still stuck of soldier of godrick,Elden Ring
consort radahn needs to be fixed,Elden Ring
i absolutely loved the based game i was looking forward to the dlc for so long i was super hyped but to my disappointment fromsoftware decided to say screw the casual gamer that enjoyed everything that made elden ring so great instead of just building on top of the formula they had in elden ring base game for difficulty they decided to make it so that you have to practically beat every boss hitless god forbid if you take one hit that you will never have time to do anything else except dodge roll until your stamina bar depletes because there is literally no end to boss attack patterns if you get hit by attack you will be stun locked and hit by every other attack you can never heal or make an attack hell you cant even summon a damn spirit ash at the beginning of most boss fights i get that souls games are supposed to be hard but i would rather have dinner with hannibal lector and watch a movie with jeffrey dahmer than get a fed by everything in this god forsaken dlc i put hundreds of hours into this game trying new builds trying out the different and cool mods that people made just to be told to go f myself by fromsoftware until they fix this broken ass dlc elden ring can go suck my praetor rykard,Elden Ring
game seems to be suffering from frequent frame drops midfight freezing stuttering since the dlc dropped im running it with an rtx a ryzen processor and no issues whatsoever running equally demanding games the game is great but this needs to be fixed,Elden Ring
i honestly love the game and have no issues with frames stuttering and ive loved all the other from soft games too but i gotta be honest this dlc is pretty fucking dog the enemies are cool i love the attack patterns and weapons but the scarcity of the enemies just feels pretty dry and to even do any damage to bosses in general you have to spend like hours just collecting scadutree fragments fromsoft lost their touch this is just sad,Elden Ring
decent game but overall one of the worst fs titles close behind ds of the open world is empty filler content tons of lifeless copypasted bosses from older fs titles side dungeons are offensively dull that said the main dungeons and bosses are fantastic but only make up about of the world and content i mainly leave a negative review cause fromsofts pc ports are beyond unacceptable at this point first person shooter cap no fov setting overall bad performance even worse now with the dlc patch like what the fuck,Elden Ring
i enjoyed the main game i expended hrs on my postscript on it across years then i even bought it for pc unfurtunately the dlc is garbage this is what happens when you hurt the feelings of the developers by saying their game was too easy they simply resort to one shot you on any boss fight where you have to dodge dodge and then dodge until you have a tiny window to strike back i gave up on the eighth boss i went out trying to find shards to level a bit i found myself getting kill by any random dude on the field really stressing game elden ring orginal gave you the chance that at some point just be powerful enough by leveling something that a none hardcore gamer like me will do but the dlc traps you on the dynamic where no matter how many shards you get they are numbered and have a limit therefore you will be one shot anyway thus forcing you to be very skillful i think a better solution as a developer should have been by reseting your level and basically restart the game then you will be able to re use your weapons at some point that been said i uninstalled the game to avoid further tentation i got really estressed with the bosses i must have died times easily in that boss fight so i did not lack the tries but i was not really enjoying the game like the first one and that is pretty unfurtunate since i was really waiting for this dlc,Elden Ring
this game should have never been open world massive mistake everything is hard in this game and that includes knowing where tf you are and where to go next,Elden Ring
the hitching and stutters is still unbelievable if you say you dont have it you are lying or you cant see it or care please take the teaching from valve shader pipelinedriven stutter isnt the majority of the big hitches weve seen in that game the recent example weve highlighted has more to do with the game creating many thousand resources such as command buffers at certain spots which was making our memory manager go into overdrive trying to handle it we cache such allocations more aggressively now which seems to have helped a ton,Elden Ring
steam deck user account was banned recently after recent or dlc patch says innappropriate activity detected unable to start in online mode upon start can no longer play online seen hundreds on other threads saying the update did the same but no update from fromsoftware other than some stupid issue with controls being locked on steam deck after inactivity would think this would be higher priority will not be even considering purchasing the dlc until fixed its hard af,Elden Ring
talk about a waste of potential still cant actually play with any friends complete waste of time playing this dogshit,Elden Ring
with new dlc drop game can sometimes run at first person shooter i have a and ryzen wait for optimization,Elden Ring
anything good i had to say about this game was washed away when i arrived at malenia fight is unecessary totally unbalanced and overall dogshtan undodgeable skill that takes a min tutorial on youtube to learn how to dodge and only if you get the miliseconds right sidestep attack right after you click right mouse button and a nd phase that is the worst sht ur company ever created player been complaining since the start about it yet no one cares and thats the reason why i dont reccomend it for any souls player,Elden Ring
people have ultrawide monitors they have advantage in seeing more lets add black bars on top of the extended area yes great idea also dont bother altering rendering the stuff behind the area were going to remove its going to be overlayed in black so doesnt matter if its rendered in first great idea thatll save us a lot of work making something proper yes shit on,Elden Ring
this game is trash the combat system is horrible and bugged beyond understanding you dodge perfectly and still take all of an attacks damage trash mechanics this game is by far the worst game i have ever played and i played anthem at release this game is not worth the money it is not worth the invested time it takes to learn the bugged out combat system that does not work ever you parry doesnt work you block doesnt work you attack before they attack doesnt work you dodge perfectly doesnt work this game is bad dont buy it dont invest any amount of fucking time into this absolute dog shit trash can fire of a fucking game,Elden Ring
this game is like a great comic book with fantastic art and amazing plot except all the talk bubbles are empty and you need to cross check different sources online to get the most out of the story and believe me you dont have that kind of time unless you are a lifeless miyazaki cultist consider that if you are into games because of the story and story telling because this game has zero story telling thumbs down because its overrated,Elden Ring
elden ring is like a good game but if it was bad,Elden Ring
game is for no life fucking losers who want to punish themselves for being adult virgins dont get it it makes me want to gauge my eyeballs out,Elden Ring
proof that anything that turns mainstream becomes overhyped and lower in quality,Elden Ring
worst camera ever got tired of the ° turns all the time coz every boss jumps all over the place in this dlc my first person shooter drops to on a loved the bosses in elden ring killed every last one bosses here are just strange,Elden Ring
avoid this dlc it not worth it especialy since it only has bs bosses that only attack for almost an hour before you can attack back not to mantion the broken hit boxes on almost all of them,Elden Ring
i love fromsoft games i loved dark souls i loved sekiro i loved souls if you are bad at games like i am dont play elden ring i dont think i really had any fun at any point in the game i just felt lost and like i was fighting hard and annoying bosses for no reason getting mad at the game for no reason wandering around getting killed for no reason the bosses were never fun the levels were never fun i dont know enough about game design to argue the cause of any of these problems but that was the reality of my experience with this game i was really disappointed and my disappointment cost,Elden Ring
give me the bloodborne remaster i know your hiding it,Elden Ring
paid quid extra to break the game,Elden Ring
fix the performance please,Elden Ring
ds is better,Elden Ring
i was so happy to play the dlc until it decided to ban me from online play for inappropriate activity detected dont know how primarily playing offline and occasionally doing coop constitutes that but yeah super glad i spent an extra on the dlc just to get banned do not support this game,Elden Ring
unplayable elden ring is one of the best games ever and one of my favorite fromsoftware games i expect more from them though ever since the dlc was released it has been unplayable i have attempted to play the game times it hasnt booted correctly times froze and crashed times and has been fine once this needs to get patched otherwise ill never even make it to the dlc,Elden Ring
performance was really bad sudden first person shooter drops out of nowhere make the game pretty unplayable,Elden Ring
its just kinda boring the plot is hardly there and the background lore is pretty basic the visuals almost carry it but the combat is boring as can be the loop is supposed to be that you get shmacked by the boss at first but then you get better and beat the boss big satisfaction payout except not really after the first few bosses i realized getting good was just memorizing boss movesets and matching your pattern to theirs it becomes very formulaic and monotonous its like the electronic simon says game the disc with colors turned into combat if you buy blasphemous you get the same feel but with more plot better art direction and cheaper,Elden Ring
this is not an rpg you cant beat it however you like you have to find a broken build use summons and all the game gives you but if you wanna beat it with a weird rpg build its imposible just find a meta and enjoy,Elden Ring
things i dont like in the game input reading flashy moves that are so fast that players are unable to see what even hit them on some bosses the camera is downright atrocious larval tears respec regent is limited in number for no intelligent reason on a similar note not being able to fully upgrade every weapon is not ideal is there a real reason for this seems to me the game would be just as good if not better if you could purchase the final smiting stone or somber stone to upgrade the weapon fully the sizes of some enemies are too large for the speed at which they move the bears in particular large attack reach fast and relentless = not fun at all delayed attacks are kind of a bad game mechanic this is because it messes with the rhythm which is not a good thing in my opinion malenia literally cheats as a boss she cancels staggers her waterfowl dance is poorly designed it is the flashy ability mentioned above it happens so fast that they player cannot even see what she is actually doing as such most people need to go onto youtube to learn the fight via a guide instead of being able to learn on their own this is made even worse when combined with the input reading mentioned above she activates this ability the exact frame that you swing a sword making it impossible to do anything about it as after you are staggered by the first strike its almost impossible if not completely impossible to dodge or block the second flurry without dying another thing that i dont like is the hyper armor mechanic this is essentially there to give input reading teeth this is because the ai starts the animation on the same frame as your swing but if they didnt have hyper armor your swing would still stagger them to make sure input reading works they give the ai hyperarmour killing the player even though they struck first large enemies like giants and dragons i think its stupid that we have to swing at their feet i believe that such fights should require bows make bows more useful have ammo be purchasable have a weakpoint around the head of the giant or dragon that needs to be hit by an arrow swinging at the feet is a lame i believe i am a pc player and i believe the inventory system is bad having to cycle between items is not ideal when compared to the fast pace of the game simply having a button to activate the pouch and then mapping a second button to a specific item that is flask would make things better i think instead of having to cycle between your whole pouch mapping dash and roll on the same button is not ideal sometimes this causes to do the opposite of what is intended that is dashing instead of rolling or the opposite the fact that there is no option to separate the two is the problem if you bind them together by default its ok if the player can change the bind for each individually but they dont have that option when your horse dies in battle you can revive it by using a flask what is really bad is that it opens up a yes or no prompt for this would you like to use a flask to resurrect torrent yn that is incredibly dumb time is of the essence when im fighting a dragon why do i have to waste it my time to click yes i would not have clicked on it if didnt have the intention to use it had i miss clicked it would be on me if i die in fire while im struggling with this bad menu its on the game developers this could had been patched out but the game has been out for years why is this still a thing i think hidden mechanics are stupid for example the diminishing returns of stat upgrades why are there diminishing returns at say which are then removed when you get to only to once again be added when you reach of a particular stat why is this a thing compared to linear stat increases i hope they improve it in future games but i highly doubt it they will do anything about it,Elden Ring
fuck this stupid ass game none of myt attacks fucking work,Elden Ring
already loads of people summarized the issues with the game,Elden Ring
fix the lag on the dlc so i can beat commander gaius,Elden Ring
dlc really bad thought people online were complaining but bosses are unfinished and buggy most zones are completely empty barely any dungeons very disappointing,Elden Ring
too long i did not read should you play it yes do i personally like it not really ive played and enjoyed every other souls game including bloodborne sekiro and demons souls and in my opinion this game isnt nearly as good as ds bloodborne or sekiro my top why everyone else seems to enjoy it thoroughly well when i first started playing elden ring i was enraptured like everybody else but the albeit very pretty visuals are a great distraction for the extremely mediocre gameplay just in terms of your own character theres an obnoxious action queue window that isnt present in other games a lot more attacks in elden ring seem well equipped to catch rolls and this is partially on the fault of the action queue where if you get hit right before you roll then in most cases your character just immediately rolls once the hitstun concludes a similar story with consecutive player attacks and et cetera it gives the game an exceedingly clunky feel in terms of actual boss and enemy design most enemies in the entire game have multiple of these attributes way too much health andor damage this occurs in virtually every dlc enemy obnoxious projectilesfire breath constantly jumps around the arenaruns away way too much shit going on to follow what the enemy is doing has a oneshot attack of some kind too many attacks too quickly its just not fun the game doesnt make me want to get better at it the game makes me want to stop playing the game im aware ill just be told to get good by the community but the poor gameplay is not an issue i usually have with fromsoft games so many bosses feel like they would be better if the game had a sekiroesque parry system in some cases like malenia its partially because they literally just ripped sekiro anims for their moveset i have plenty of other issues with the game such as the dlc like the main game being excellent visually and awful gameplaywise the generally terrible weapon system they learned nothing from bloodborne torrent feeling bad to control and being unable to use in some areas the map being badinaccurate and how you cant open your map in combat and the completely nonsensical lore but i dont care to talk about them in length ultimately and reluctantly i must recommend the experience for nothing more than to experience more fromsoft content and statistically whoever is reading this review is far more likely to enjoy the game than i am i just dont like it and dont think its particularly fun or special,Elden Ring
this game should never be recreated ever again,Elden Ring
performance dropped in base game after dlc released fix it please i got first person shooter before the update now im getting first person shooter even in the base game regions,Elden Ring
i wont buy dlc until there is support for ultrawide monitors,Elden Ring
being lvl hours and was on ng+ prior to the dlc release ive realised that dying for hours trying to kill ymir mother of fingers and bayle the dread that im not that good it feels like this dlc is on ng+ seems like their movesets are infinite and they are moving too fast for being that bigso far feel as though ive wasted my,Elden Ring
the base game is difficult but fun this dlc is complete and utter horseshit everything in the dlc besides the bosses and annoying fucking mobs is great they hone in on you like a fucking magnet from across the map with a crazy ass attack combo that can kill you in hits and then after youre done dodging for a whole minute maybe you can sneak in around damge out of the health bar if they dont run away right away,Elden Ring
id rather kill myself than recommend a game where the only reason anything is hard is because the devs decided to troll people with doors that mobs get caught on and you cant shoot through or some other random bug that kills you rather than genuine difficulty its like stellar blade and the subway car that rolls over you nonstop elden ring is a trolley car running over you over and over again and saying haha i played a practical joke on you practical jokes take zero intelligence to create a practical joke could be pushing someone down stairs troll this bitches imagine being so fucking dumb you thought it was fucking cool to block ultrawide for everyone cause youre that fucking disconnected from real life,Elden Ring
fuck elden ring and fromsoft just got banned for no fucking reason,Elden Ring
anything that is good about this game is ruined by the frustrating boss battles game is difficult for the sake of being difficult nothing is fair bosses have next to no stamina limit and one shot you dlc takes it to beyond ridiculous limits get one r hit and then dodge for minutes hopping not to get one shot or staggered to death but you die anyway because you have no clue about the second phase move set or some bs one shot move which requires frame perfect dodges but wait you think you can dodge no because input reading so basically long boring unfair boss battles which are a mixture of trial and error with luck nothing about that process is fun i had more fun playing dark souls and i find tekken easier than this game,Elden Ring
crucible knight and misbegotten are like aids fuck you miyazaki,Elden Ring
let me preface this by saying this entire review is strongly based on my own personal enojoyment of from soft games and not everyone will agree as game elden ring is masterpiece it is incredibly well made with almost zero bugs it has thousands of hours of content with a huge open world that can be played in so many different ways the level design is amazing some of the best levels in video game history every legacy dungeon looks amazing and has so many hidden details and lore one legacy dungeon from elden ring is better then most entire games it looks amazing runs smooth and the build varitiy is astounding theyre so many cool weapons to play with this game is ever green one of the best video games made period it was last forever and is peak of video games as far i see every game in genre should be compared too and learn from fromsoft the reason i said all that above is because i believe it elden ring is a masterpiece yet one singular aspect that keeps me playing other souls games is completely ruined the boss fights and gameplay fromsoft has gained a reputation for making hard games what orginally was supposed to a way of telling the story quickly turned into the main draw fromsoft games are hard so mastering them becomes rewarding this is quite literally baked into the dark souls story if you give up quit because a boss was to challenging you are a hollow if you get through it you become the chosen undead this has proven to be nothing more then a massive road block and ruins elden ring fromsoft has tried to hard to keep up their reputation of being hard games they created boss and enemy design that is mechanically not fun to play they have never adpated to a different system theyve stuck with the roll attack style of game play loop they used it for games in a row and everytime they run into the same problem the only way to make the game harder is to make the game play loop harder attack in this game are no longer well telegraphed have intuitive design have a core theme around them every single bosses needed random attacks to be delayed come up super fast have huge magical aoe effects on everything apply a status effect boss fight attack are deigned first to trick the player rather then to create an interesting encounter they make attacks so well timed they punish roll spamming to the exact frame just to kill you faster because thats what player wanted right we like dying in dark souls games no we didnt we liked dying because death was something we could improve on they this concept to the extreme by making it so you have to die to a boss many times to even understand what its doing so many bosses attack for so long and so often youre not even allowed to play the video game for half the time dark souls and bosses would at most have a hit combo once in a while elden ring basic mobs have upwards of attack combos it just memorization and not actual skill in dark souls if you saw an enemy raise a sword at you one could easily tell when and how to dodge it logically if you see someone raising a sword you know that has weight and cannot be maintained so it has to drop at some point you can see the mobs arms dropping and arcing downwards so you know when to dodge the slash elden ring knows this an goes against the design just to make it harder if an enemy is raising a sword to slash at you its complete luck as to know when theyll swing it it could be instant or they make a slight motion on slash only a randomly hold their stance for just to trick you its like their is a check list of hard moves to dodge that from has and every boss needed to tick a certain amount before it can be a boss it needs to have delayed attacks need huge aoe attacks needs long combos needs roll punishes need healing or spell casting punishes it makes the game un fun to play in dark souls for the most part you and the enemy were the same you roughly do the same things with the same power level if you failed your attack you get punished if the enemy failed their attack they get punished that just is not true anymore elden ring bosses will do dragon ball z anime combos that have them fly and twirl in the air sending hundrerds of magic blasts at you with infinite stammina with massive aoe blasts flooding the screen with effects and then only then can you maybe get one hit off not to mention the fact that every boss need to a stat monster that shots you if are level playing field they made bosses to unfun to play against they literally give you the option to summon an ally that draws aggro for you lets you upgrade them and create op spells or skills that can safely kill them the casual player nowadays does not even attempt to play the game they just summon allies sit back and spam ranged magic with maximized stats because trying to fight these bosses is terrible its not fun getting one shot its not fun having bosses input read so you have run across the map just to heal its not fun fighting bosses that can dash or teleport top you in frames its not fun fighting something with hotboxes so large the cover most of the entire arena every boss need to be more have more spectacle have more gimmicks do more damage have more health every boss need a phase transition that looks epic thats not the reason i liked play the souls games bosses where supposed to be challenging to make it feel rewarding i dont feel rewarded after killing any boss in elden ring the entire time fighting them i bored out of mind having my skillset locked because i cannot play any other way then dodging at the right time and getting one single hit in every seconds its no wonder every player looks how to get op fast videos on youtube or use op magic or use any tatic at all to empower themselves its because these bosses are not fun they tried so hard to upkeep their reputation as a hard video game that theyve failed to make it fun its not fighting them at equal level nor it is fun over statting them for all its years of development time hunrderds of thousands of hours of man power millions in costs to be made i genuinely cannot think of single boss i enjoy fighting more then any of the previous games i re played dark souils out of nowhere just because i wanted to fight midir and gael two bosses made me play another hours of that game of which i beaten times i do not think about a single boss in elden ring i dont want to spend hours roaming the open world and google the one specific piece of loot i need to make a proper build it feels like i need to spend hours just start the game because while this amazing and huge open world makes it fun to explore when youve already explored it all it then turns into a choir theyve strayed away from what made dark souls game special they keep getting bigger more epic more everything and missing the basic fundamentals of making a good game so many brain dead players will just shout get gud because they cannot take any critisicm of their beloved game and attach themselves to it trust me ive played these game for decades ive done more challenge runs then you can even think of and yet i have zero interest in coming back to play this i came back for the dlc expecting it to better as fromsoft always improves their games with dlc only to find out they made an entire new system that forces you explore the world for specific items because they made bosses so over tunned and over statted these new items give masssive stat boosts only in the dlc if that doesnt show the problem i dont know what will trying playing your beloved game with out and having to spend minutes fighting a boss that will one shot you at every singe mistake id love die hard fans play through that and tell me they dont see a problem but knowing them they just google the location of all the items anyways,Elden Ring
the dlc ruined this game for me it has so many dogshit designs its not difficult its just boring spamming ranged enemys in addition to your boss that can tap you with heavy armor isnt hard its boring random and infuriating it doesnt feel like its my fault i died same thing with puzzles in the dlc they dont make sense even less than normal darksouls puzzles and storylines how the fuck am i supposed to figure out that i have to die times in the same way before something happens i just cant with this dlc anymore i wish i never played it it honestly ruined my experience with this otherwise brilliant game also the messages have become just plain unfunny and annoying horse ahead isnt funny guys its just annoying,Elden Ring
not a big fan of action games so far to be honest but the camara lag and overall combat is bad just spam dodging while bosses look fancy and have cool animated attacks,Elden Ring
everything works as intended miyazaki is just a giant troll,Elden Ring
maybe there is some greatness i`m missing but i just hate it i hate feel of open world i hate vigor check bosses with attacks that take so long you can make some tea watch whole lore of dark souls series take a nap and then dodge i hate the setting with that fucking tree and fingers or what not and most important i hate local fashion or absence of one however hard i try i just cant find armor i could call beautiful or even slightly cool i`m sorry elden ring i can`t find a reason to love you c,Elden Ring
unnecessarily difficult not much fun obviously made for certain group of players,Elden Ring
stutters uncontrollably poor compataility looks bad in game at k my pc is idling and its bad refundingtill they fix dlc bug,Elden Ring
fix mesmers fucking hitboxes holy shit,Elden Ring
i wondered why the reviews re mixed now i know the game is amazing looks amazing aand the new weapons designs are a chefs kiss but how hard they hit the amount of health the enemys have doesnt matter how much vigor you have the dlc is stupidly unbalanced you are but an ant to be trampled on melania was easy compared to the two hitting anything in this dlc gave it a go not for me good luck to you ima stick to elden ring predlc,Elden Ring
if this is the level of difficulty you need to enjoy a game or find it challenging then take a break from gaming after hours in base i am tired of bashing my head against the wall on new dlc bosses it no longer a fighting game and is just ddr hit this button on this exact tempo at this exact time rinse and repeat until you learn the boss which is just hoping to get one hit in after minutes of chasing and dodging while they iceskate in mediocre air all over the map i know these games are supposed to be challenging but at what point do they stop being fun and just feel like you and sprinting against someone who is in a car and you are in quicksand,Elden Ring
i will flip my vote as soon as you add wide screen support this is beyond stupid you are literally blocking the view on both sides with black panels instead of allowing me to use my whole screen,Elden Ring
evasion when the focus is on the boss or any other captured target does not work correctly i die from my own skill of the action of the bloodhound in times more than from errors related to gameplay thank you very much that evasion works in the exact opposite direction,Elden Ring
got banned for no reason due to a glitch after hours thanks fromsoft,Elden Ring
ive never seen a worse camera control in a game and every thing is tied to its position,Elden Ring
bloated and unfocused given the pretty yet highly flawed and repetitive it only makes sense that its made by the dark souls guy i hope miyazaki makes a game for dark souls fans one day,Elden Ring
great game already have one playthrough on postscript bought it on pc for better graphics but it doesnt have ultrawide support that sucks half of my screen is black and i dont want to use a mod cuz i want to play with others pls add ultrawide support pls,Elden Ring
commander gaius is the worst boss desing the soulslike series ever seen rework or nerf it immideately,Elden Ring
excellent base game cant play the dlc due to absolutely terrible optimisation,Elden Ring
worst dlc dificultt for a souls game ever trashes,Elden Ring
great game zero ultrawide support,Elden Ring
not my game,Elden Ring
this second time in a week i got kick of game with inappropriate activity detected have to verify game again to play what the fuck fix your goddamn game,Elden Ring
not saying anything about the game play just noting the facts to have work you need to heavily mod the game as it is forced disabled with features that block you from having it work to have the game work properly on an amd gpu you also will need to search your issues and change ini settings and other modifications to files ect to have the game function the fact that i have spent ages trying to get the game to function i would not suggest it to people who have amd gpu and ultrawide screens unless you really want to play,Elden Ring
new dlc update completely butchered the performance even outside the dlc areas that is in the base game making the game pretty much unplayable when it worked perfectly fine beforehand,Elden Ring
these are my feelings towards the game so far i wish i saw what everybody sees in this game but i dont everybody criticizes ubisoft for making go from point a to point b and then to point c to finish a checklist games but elden ring is like that too so thats some real double standards right here bosses are rather unfun and sometimes unnecessarily hard its supposed to be a hard game i get it but sekiro didnt have a problem like this i enjoyed almost every boss fight and never thought something was unfair i dont see any environmental storytelling in this game did i miss something i will continue to play maybe i will change my mind maybe i just need to change playstyles or maybe the game is just not for me,Elden Ring
l game,Elden Ring
game is great main game is very good shadow of the erdtree however is plagued with the same performance issues the game had at launch lagging stuttering and freezing regardless of graphic settings just isnt acceptable for any aaa but particularly for one that is as inputreaction dependant as fromsoft games,Elden Ring
very good hours of playtime then the patch made my game crash on startup linuxproton will refund the dlc if it doesnt get fixed in the next weeks because i literally cant play the game anymore if youre on linuxproton you probably cant play this game right now,Elden Ring
i wouldnt buy for pc until they get the performance issues figured out if you are going to charge full price for a port at least invest in making it perform on the pc as well as it does on the much less powerful playstation,Elden Ring
every day the hardest fight is to keep the game running or get it to run,Elden Ring
the fallen leaves tell a story about the great age of stuttering,Elden Ring
dont get it if you get mad cuz bad its not linear or story driven it doesnt hold your hand whatsoever arguably it pushes you over the cliff as a player will be playing every dlc,Elden Ring
i do not recommend this dlc not because it is too hard but because the story is bad and wont spoil also this is a horrible map that is too difficult to navigate due to a lack of clarity of how to get from most places to others whick a lot of the time requires you to find a hidden mini dungeon to progress which is what you spend most of your time doing which compounds with the problem that if the game is too hard gathering the resources to make it more balanced requires you to search this horrible map which of the third has nothing for you which is the opposite of the based game which has something no matter where you go another problem is the againresulted bosses from the dlc and base game while there are quite a lot of new bosses most of them are placed several times around the map which reduces the pleasure of defeating them after seeing them again and again,Elden Ring
im fine with the game difficulty it is supposed to be difficult so im statisfied however please fix the stutter issues its like the release of the base game its not properly optimised for pc,Elden Ring
as much as this game is hyped up and has some serious curb appeal with the art style world buildinglore the game runs like trash even on high end pcs fromsoft is more worried about packing in drm denuvo anticheat causing the game to stutter during combat poor advanced graphical options and no dlss or fsr support in for a modern game the developer can add these things at a near zero cost and greatly increasing quality of gameplay experience for everyone game menus are just horrible to navigate something out of type stuff and trying to coop play with a friend is a pure roll of the dice if its works at all or if its a lag fest it should not be this difficult to coop play with a friend their coop gameplay isnt really a true coop your progression is all tied to your solo gameplay and doesnt support any true coop features like other games do the game should have some type of disclaimer about their version of coop character stories are very interesting at least,Elden Ring
if i have to shoot that dam bird one more time ima pull my toe nails out,Elden Ring
the game doesnt even open it loads like of the bar and stops,Elden Ring
first person shooter lock + roblox graphics on max settings combat was good but not good enough for me to continue on might try again someday overall,Elden Ring
id rather drag my ball sack across broken glass shards than play this game,Elden Ring
they set the game to max hard mode got to the final boss walk in summon boss opening attack he uses percent of start of fight loss percent of life die seconds later only managed to get him past first phase tried using summons for the dlc the die way to quick even with the scadutree both maxed out,Elden Ring
lul not enough space for update so we just deleted the gbs rather than wait for you to give us more space smd,Elden Ring
not supporting widescreen and locked first person shooter is bs for a modern game,Elden Ring
the new update kept giving me the inappropriate activity detected message i do not have mods on nor do i cheat in this game kindly fix this seeing as this is a needless hassle to have to go through,Elden Ring
dude this game makes me want to kill myself all the fuckin time but its so rewarding to beat a boss that has been shitting down ur throat but its very rare,Elden Ring
this is so hard i died times to the haredest boss in the game soldier of godrick never playiong again hawk tuah,Elden Ring
this game is awful and feels dead,Elden Ring
the dlc has some annoying as hell bugs that make the enemys unenjoyable to fight,Elden Ring
i got banned for zero reasons and now i cant play the game with my friends,Elden Ring
new patch fuced up the performance it constantly shutters plus it shutters the computer and i dont even own the dlc,Elden Ring
i love the original game but from needs to relax with some of the bosses in dlc they rush in and pummel you with speed huge hits and no way to defend heal or counter its a little excessive and i consider myself pretty good at this game there is a fine line between punishing players and encouraging strategy and this is not strategy,Elden Ring
loved the game absolutely loved it after beating the game i havent touched it in years until the dlc came out only to find out that a majority of my grace sites have disappeared and i wasted money on your dumb ass fucking dlc fuck this i want a refund i am going to get a refund i do not have time to activate all the grace sites again just to get to the area i need to get to to play this fucking dlc go fuck yourself fromsoftware,Elden Ring
bs,Elden Ring
game ran well until i installed the update just now i dont even have the dlc just the base game a lot of lag and stutter,Elden Ring
game makes me want to kill myself dlc hitboxes r insanely good,Elden Ring
returned to the game after years and its still clunky and runs like sht bravo,Elden Ring
game wont let me play online anymore getting inappropriate activity error after not having done anything the only inappropriate activity is fromsoft actively degrading the quality of my purchase,Elden Ring
this game isnt good making things annoying isnt making the game hard a rat should hit harder than a dragons breathe multiple bugs and crashes almost one of the worst multiplayer experiences to deal with so many reused assets final boss isnt new new weapons and armor are mediocre shadowlandsmore like empty lands back and fourth through tedious geographical puzzles,Elden Ring
im only leaving a bad review as im experiencing graphics stuttering issues when playing the game games great otherwise once they fix the stuttering issues that i know alot of other people are experiencing not just myself i will happily change this review back to a positive as the game is actually really good,Elden Ring
game runs worse than cyberpunk day buggy ah controls i do not know why people think this game is good,Elden Ring
for the dlc only buy if you enjoy dodging boss attacks for seconds at a time perfectly to get a single fast attack in good luck dodging since every boss attack is a delayed aoe attack,Elden Ring
cant dodge roll game sux,Elden Ring
i am going to be completely honest this game is a masterpiece and the new dlc is god tier but holy shit the performance is ass why sully this god tier game by releasing the dlc and basically making the game have the same issues as on launch the performance issues even have leaked into the main game which means they clearly messed something up will be keeping as negative until i dont have to add an extra tries on bosses because of run ending first person shooter issues,Elden Ring
what is even the point of this game holy fuck people are troling or maybe all the rest of aaa crap is so bad that this game looks good kids remember pirate games first to see if you like or not it can save you a lot of frustation,Elden Ring
worst game ever the bosses to easy,Elden Ring
im not being polite about this the rest of the game is fine but the dlc has problems the scaling is terrible everything deals too much damage to anyone saying just be better your opinion is bad the miquella fight is terrible all of the others are fine but miquella needs a nerf for me to even begin to consider this dlc even decent singelhandedly ruined my enjoyment of the rest of the dlc,Elden Ring
at no point did this game not feel like a chore i tried my absolute best to have fun but ive finally accepted that i flushed down the drain buying the game and dlc and im throwing in the towel if someone recommends that you play elden ring assume that theyre an uninteresting person with no real hobbies,Elden Ring
you need to be a year old loser thats weights + pounds over bmi in order to beat this game or have no job or life,Elden Ring
i paid to get dunked on by a giant crab,Elden Ring
i wasted too much of my life on an unpleasant experience highly recommend going on a hike or just going outside instead,Elden Ring
terrible too much damage taken in the dlc,Elden Ring
cannot recommend due to shader stutters i get that it gets better over time but the beauty of a game like this is the first time you discover something the feeling you get is amazing however the pc ports shader compilation stutters really negatively affects a first playthrough i dont know how it cannot have been fixed after all this time,Elden Ring
after recent patch i cant make it minutes into the game without crashing,Elden Ring
i dont like the game not worth it dont like the engine,Elden Ring
the performance is bad and its can even get above first person shooter tried all the settings even tried turning off ray tracing and putting the game on low and still bad performance and jittering dont buy until they fix,Elden Ring
h the new blessings system ruins the dlc h my problem is not the difficulty the weaponsbosses and new areas in the dlc are so cool but legit most of my playtime with the dlc has just been running around and getting scadutree fragments around the map so i can fight the bosses without getting shot and honestly the new leveling system would not be an issue if you didnt need to find different scadutree fragments that are all required to have any chance against the bosses this new leveling system is tedious and not i dont understand what fromsoftware were thinking with this shit and if they dont change the leveling system i probably wont ever touch the dlc after i beat it because it gonna be a chore to replay,Elden Ring
constant attacking bosses with one shot mechanics that cant be dodgedcant recommend that,Elden Ring
the dlc ruins this game in pretty much every way technical issues balancing issues and so on,Elden Ring
you know what i really want to play after a hard shitty week at work a game that has unavoidable attacks that do of my health if only i knew that before i spent an extra two controllers later and i decided to put this game down and play something else worth my limited time to play games as a normal working man must be nice to get paid to play games and stay on a boss for half a day when i can get lucky to spend an hour to play a game and this is what i get thanks elden ring dont change a fuckin thing,Elden Ring
from software if you dont want mouse and keyboard players to play your stupid friking game then dont friking port it ffs but if you are going to take our damned money then spend at least half of one goddamned afternoon to make it actually viable instead of continually releasing the worlds dumbest mkb schematics that cant be properly customized i am seriously starting to hate japanese studios with a passion and its not like this disdain wasnt completely avoidable with even secondthought level effort greedy little weebs hyping garbage like this is downright embarrassing,Elden Ring
everything was fine till the update now if i try and play it crashes after a minute or so,Elden Ring
its tough to say but overall the game is a mustplay the lore and gameplay combined with the massive world are amazing the reason i cannot recommend this is coop issues on top of the ban system i peerpressured a buddy of mine to get the game so that we could play together and make it to the dlc and he agreed i reinstalled the elden ring as i have not played in the yearplus well behold i have this day timeout thing going on and when i reached out to the company they told me get fucked wait till days i assume i must be for a rd party program i have on my pc as this is my work pc on top of it being personal and maybe something faulty in the system,Elden Ring
the dlc contains some of the worst designed bosses in the entirety of the series pretty amazing how they just decided to forget how to make a good fight,Elden Ring
i just think its a dark souls game in open world its not really that special great time killer though but i wouldnt recommend it unless you are vulnerable to social manipulation,Elden Ring
kinda bland kinda boring wants you to explore but doesnt really reward it well and feels like the devs focussed on quantity of areas rather than the quality the other souls games got,Elden Ring
evil game made by evil people,Elden Ring
any game where the most important and most used ability dodge triggers only on its keybinds release instead of its keybinds press and you cant change it in the settings anywhere is a thumbs down for me they decided to make their whole game feel clunky and unresponsive to combine a couple actions into one button and you cant change it what a disaster this is also the worst pc port for a big developer that i have ever seen instead of using mouse buttons to navigate your inventory like how any other program or application works on a pc you navigate your inventory using q and e and you cant change it in the settings this is just one example of how nothing about the ui for mouse and keyboard is intiutive at all defualt settings are basically unusable and you cant change most of it ive never seen anything like this,Elden Ring
the fact this game uses easy anticheat and still has not had its performance issues fixed after years is enough for me to give it a negative review a good game but some of the worst optimization for pc from software has ever done,Elden Ring
performance issues,Elden Ring
wildly unbalanced masochistic affair difficulty for the sake of difficulty is lame artificially difficult bosses and by that i mean theyre not difficult mechanically they just ate buffed to the moon,Elden Ring
as a piece of provocative art this is a magnificent achievement sublime it is deeply philosophical and very moving the design and writing in this game will keep you playing it deserves all the praise and it really is that special people fall in love with this game me included this is despite not because of the game mechanics itself people will try to tell you otherwise its a sort of willing blindness to the games quirks and deficiencies because of the awe the world built within it inspires as a piece of art it is a masterpiece as a game it is hot garbage i mean it this is why do you like mashing buttons and wondering why nothing is happening regardless of how much stamina is left in your meter i hope so because youll be doing a lot of this and even better it is impossible to tell when your input is just being ignored or your character will eventually get to doing everything you asked seconds ago while the boss has changed tactics and left your earlier deferred action worse than irrelevant youre then left helpless while the boss does several combos in a row tearing you apart ever driven a year old uhaul truck across the country because its all you could get in time to move thats how controlling this game feels every action takes forever including using healing potions while your character is giving the healing process all the urgency of a pleasant tea party with aristocracy every enemy on screen will corner you and pummel you to hell leaving you sitting for entire minutes waiting for the inevitable all the actions are so telegraphed and slow that you have to plan ahead and sometimes you just cant learn on the fly fast enough and have no opportunity to change course do you love watching the camera angle blur the entire screen to the point you cant see anything in the middle of a complicated battle well youre in luck if you pick this game at least a solid quarter of the times ive died in this game ive had no idea why because theres just too much jumbled mess on the screen to make anything out and im just about seasick while trying to figure it out do you really appreciate it when what is visibly on screen has little relation to what actually matters well elden ring has your back here again go ahead and dodge out of the range of a magic or melee attack even if it looks like youre several steps away from the area of damage you get hurt anyway be it blast of magic or a bears face what you see is not always what you get and clipping enemies can attack through walls but you cant of course thats fair it seems the only thing that matters in terms of dodging is timing not where you are or whats near you do you like powerups and items that do essentially nothing well this game is chock full of them so youre covered there too and the great thing is there are long quests that end in so little reward that your ambition will wither into nothingness if youre not prone to spite despite how much i absolutely hate this game in so many ways i still also love it every bit as much that having been said the difficulty in it does not feel balanced earned or even acceptable the difficulty is mostly from wacky imbalances in the physics and what feel like deliberate obstacles between the player and what happens in the game its not so much a puzzle to solve as it is a test of your ability to endure the absurd enjoying this game is like falling in love with someone who has experienced a lot of emotional trauma you have to accept that things are not fair or rational if youre to experience the real and potential beauty in front of you that still doesnt make it right or good you have to be honest with yourself as to whether you want to deal with this there is no right or wrong answer im likely going to finish this game but i honestly cant guarantee it fromsoftware is obviously staffed with genius from the president down this game is unfair and disgusting and it is so intentionally it is exactly the outrage that is its primary charm and the key to understanding what the game is meant to convey to the player they are making a point not just trying to entertain you if you arent up for that then you best avoid this so no if you want a game to be fun pleasant and reasonable do not get this if you like being angered and outraged or can look past the experience to enjoy deeply engaging art then here you go just be aware that you are getting into a deeply unfair depraved experience and that it will test your patience until you have nothing left,Elden Ring
fuck this game,Elden Ring
i hate this game i wish i could stop playing it,Elden Ring
the dodge roll mechanic is lame as fuck and should have been abandoned long ago that fromsoftware can go from making a game like sekiro with an insanely responsive and dynamic combat system to another roly poly simulator like elden ring is truly baffling,Elden Ring
so i played this game first seconds i was thinking its fun but then i found out that you only have to run from boss to boss nothing with skill or fun its just a jump and run game for me wouldnt recommend if you like jump and run go for it,Elden Ring
janky camera work frame drops garbage hurtboxes and artificial difficulty all in one package even after beating the game twice i still hated it the dlc did nothing but remind me how mickey mouse this game was,Elden Ring
literally would prefer to get hiv than ever play the dlc again what the fuck is this absolute tape worm of a dlc whack map whack everything would prefer to sell my life belongings and place on red do not buy,Elden Ring
stupid glitches that reset you to ur last save trying bosses for years and finally getting them is a nice feeling but i just hate having to do bosses again whom i struggled with a lot,Elden Ring
random stutters and severe frame drops that require a restart to fix machine above recommended specs please fix,Elden Ring
elden ring is just not my game and im sad that i bought it i could have bought a better game for myself but i instead bought a game that i will never ever touch again souls likes in generale are not my type of game i tried i realy did but its just to goddamn complicated if i wanna die over and over again then i atleast wanna have fun doing it and for those who will comment gid gud why dont you try getting good at getting some bitches,Elden Ring
my problem with this isnt its difficulty these games have always been tough especially in early game my problem with this dlc is the leveling system the dlc scales to your characters current level and the only way to increase your damage and resistance to enemies is to find a seemingly finite item to level your stats this means that if you just cant get past an enemy or a boss you can no longer go grind levels to make yourself stronger and come back better prepared instead you have to go searching for an item in the world and if youve already found them all well too bad now you have to bash your head against a concrete wall till you beat whatever was stopping you if you can even beat it its a poorly designed system that makes defeating enemies feel worthless since the currency they drop does nothing for you its a beautiful game and its incredibly fun to explore just like the base game but holy crap i cant state enough how much i hate this this new leveling system this needs a change somehow,Elden Ring
i was having fun with the dlc until i made it to the point in the game where i burned down a small tree doing so locked me out of every quest line in the game why wouldnt they give any indication that this would happen before doing so lost out on a ton of items and story all because of this bull and if i could request a refund i would,Elden Ring
what would be a decent game is entirely eclipsed by its performance issues i have tried every solution to no avail the game crashes regardless every five minutes i also cannot get a refund meaning i am stuck with this nonfunctional slop i deeply regret buying this game avoid it,Elden Ring
would you recommend this game to other players steam asked me hmmm actually i hadnt played in a while and tried to get back into the game to see if the recent dlc might be of interest to me when i originally finished elden ring i played mostly on steam deck in handheld as i was unable to play on the big screen at the time the performance was not great but okay between then and now performance actually improved considerably which is nice but controls are a mess specifically the gamepad prompts when not playing handheld are useless unless you specifically use a deckstyle abxy gamepad elden ring as of this review will not display proper prompts for sony playstation dualshock postscript gamepad or nintendo switch pro controllers so yeah this is why i would not recommend this game to other players using any of those controllers while playing on a big screen heard the devs are caring about steam reviews right now due to the dlc maybe theyll include proper prompts in a future patch ill keep a look out for that before coming back simple fix actually,Elden Ring
cant sex the lobster,Elden Ring
just simply hated this game,Elden Ring
why is the dlc alone more expensive than the full game + dlc,Elden Ring
call me a clown bad or tell me to get gud i dont care this game just isnt fun thats all,Elden Ring
dont buy this game if ur going into it for pvp its hopeless projectile spam and devs dont care about making it less miserable,Elden Ring
itll get my thumbs up when the micro stuttering stops getting me killed during combat other then that god damn i love this game,Elden Ring
shit game overated,Elden Ring
this is for the dlc base game is omfg get the lube i dont even know if im enjoying this anymore or not reason being that bosses hit so frequently and hit like a god damn truck due to this using anything with a windup is literally impossible in fights unless you utilise a summon if you value your sanity use quick hitting weapons or reduvia and max out your dps in boss fights my biggest gripe with this game is that i cant play it the way i want to like the base game because the developer got a hard on against speed runners and thinks everyone is rolling over his game if bosses got some much needed delays between their attacks so more weapons are viable and the lock on camera doesnt have a seizure id be an amazing expansion i recommend the game for its exploration but when it comes to boss fights i cant recommend it yet environment music aesthetic new weapons enemy designs camera having a seizure over number of times youll swear on bosses,Elden Ring
as much as id like to like this game its just poorly balanced especially compared to previous souls entries summons threw the balance way out of wack because now you either have to choose between never ving any of the bosses because theyre so overtuned or smacking your head into the wall for days if youre the sort of person who doesnt like having a forced duo fight its just very annoying because i feel like it tries to force me to engage with an optional mechanic that im personally not a fan of,Elden Ring
inappropriate activity detected on steam deck i have barely played this game and i only have played this offline so far to be presented with a comment like this is outrageous,Elden Ring
the exploration rewards in the dlc are too bad like garbage lack of desire to explore,Elden Ring
too hard racist sexist and ableist for not having a difficulty slider how are female people of color and disabled people supposed to beat this,Elden Ring
the game freezes every minutes on a k usd machine no raytracing no maximum settings,Elden Ring
pc mkb very nice visuals but thats about it its extremely annoying to play a game where you have to constantly switch and google absolutely everything about the game quests items abilities gear characters there absolutely no information in game no gear info no weapon info so basically half of the time is spent on google ui as itself is extremely bad and hard to navigate health and damage scales extremely bad you cannot play tanky character a fucking rat can eat you even if you are level defense plays next to nothing role in game not a single fun playstyle in game tank no get rekt fek your armor zero effect archer shooting is horrible and autolock with low dmg console garbage mage visuals look cool but then you just stand there beying useless because you ran out of potions options to change specializations are limited a bit annoying look customization is next to none just add a damn free transmongs and respec so + visuals no mana horsepower regen passively no animation canceling the character would rather die instead of cancel the seconds swing build up and dodge theres no quest log zero clue where to go or what to do you just roaming around randomly absolute garbage controls and ui just another controller ui where you have options squished into buttons which makes it extremely annoying annoying dialog animations barely skipable just let me got damn shop or upgrade without telling me screens of text i dont care,Elden Ring
the dlc is so overtuned its an absolute joke and this is coming from a souls player for years,Elden Ring
if you enjoy copious amounts of recycled content and an oversized empty world to explore then this is the game for you,Elden Ring
its not worth it,Elden Ring
update broke the game inappropriate activity detected,Elden Ring
after dlc performance likes chit,Elden Ring
base game fun challenging a good difficulty curve throughout visuals are great effects are great cutscenes are great compelling story alot of cool magic incantations weapons coop is locked behind a consumable item you shouldnt have to download mods that can potentially get you banned to play easily with friends tons of reused enemies as bosses which is just shameful balance patching weapons for pveother than things like chainsaw glitch is just utterly stupid oh no riverz ov blud an mnvayle kill boss fazt quest progression is super unclear just look up guides because chances are you accidentally took a step too far and it killed the quest related npc shadow of the erd tree avoid avoid avoid whoever wrote this has alot to answer forand you arent getting the answers g r r martin yet again involved with another project that didnt end well bring poise back only to make every enemy kill you in hits at vig softcap every boss has a hit grab they will land the second you are out of the animation of coming through the fog gate muh scadutree shards x literally no tangible connection to the base game or story what so ever melina who great katanas not scaling with arcane not worth not even worth years to completely subvert expectations in the worst possible way,Elden Ring
dark souls caliber game some parts great some parts awful they added a horse because they made the world too big for no reason they added crafting materials for you to pick up in these vast empty areas with nothing in them except crafting materials they made you the bloodborne main character but all the bosses are sekiro enemies tons of weapons not enough upgrade materials for nonsombers it is easier and cheaper to respec your whole character than it is to switch your weapons so much armor most of it has no point and at least of them are reskins mods are great base game is mediocre af,Elden Ring
i meet the exact recommended hardware requirements and still cant play without constant stuttering and freezes on any graphical setting i beat the game playing with freezes that would last about seconds long every minutes after returning to freshen up for the new dlc i have no idea how i played like that i have scoured the forums for fixes i have either tried them or they were so long and out there i might as well just play something else dark souls has been like this for me since launch as well,Elden Ring
dlc update broke functionality its now a crapshoot whether the game will actually be able to play at all even after file verification and when it does load it takes > minutes each time and requires another fast travel for the area to load completely,Elden Ring
id rather play dark souls than ever touch this game again somehow fromsoftware hasnt fixed the issue of lag frame stutters bugs glitches and so on and for a + game i would expect better from them this has to be the laziest game theyve ever made the world feels flat and boring and half the time i dont even care about any of the bosses that i face nor do they feel memorable or thought out at the slightest the only fight that actually tests your skills in this game is malenia but good luck trying to kill her cause the game will probably lag while you fight her i would like to have loved this game i seriously thought this game would be good but its just a stale version of other souls games trust me when i say the better version of caelid is bloodbourne the better version of leyndell is any other dark souls i really tried i tried so hard to like this game but its fucking horrible,Elden Ring
the base game of elden ring is quite good but the dlc is just aweful as a souls vetern ive beaten every single dark souls game multiple times this is just not it this dlc feels like the designers behind sekiro designed the bosses but we are still stuck with dark souls combat as the player let me start off my saying that this dlc story and exploration is amazing very well done the boss fights have major issues and i mean of them they are all super aggressive have infinite staminapoise and leave little room for any kind of mistake or counter to attempt to break their poise another thing is that the camera angles for most of the bigger bosses and some of the human sized ones puts you into a wall and they you die to not being able to see anything the last major issue i have with them is that they just deal percent of your health even with the dlc upgrade system that is not fun not engaging and not a souls game this is a for me only because of the exploration i do not reccommend buying this pile of garbage until they patch it,Elden Ring
the latest entry in fromsofts ever so stagnant roster of games i used to enjoy and play their previous games to a degree therefor i had high hopes for elden ring to improve upon the flaws of the other souls games i hoped that they would pull together an actual rpg for once in the style of previous games so far this is just more of the same with more bugs more systems that have been implemented poorly this company must have a massive management issue where they dont provide enough resources or time to their developers or simply not enough thought to the new features they want to see in the game the open world formular laid all of this even more bare than the previous entry which had blocky empty space dlc that has been split into two heavy re use of enemies and even older animations now heres my main issues with elden ring the core system the bread and butter of the game combat still feels stilted and relies on this outdated lock on that bugs out often no matter what setting you select older games have managed to nail fighting huge enemies about decades ago they knew that you have to automatically zoom out to allow the player to see what they need to see and not just one foot or the belly of a monster even monster hunter freedom managed to understand that its no fun to fight giant monsters without being able to anticipate attacks due to the camera not allowing you to see more the game is poorly balanced or rather balanced around a peticular playstyle it is most obvious to see with the choice of enemy boss behaviour bosses just have tamper tantrums and spam attacks no clear openings lots of aoe spam theres even a mechanic thats an attack punish punish the bosss behaviour is based heavily on proximity and rng for the previously mentioned attack punish punish so if you attempt to punish a boss for an attack he can roll a dice and punish you for your punish this can happen times in succession they also do animation reading yes people complain that it is technically not input reading but does it really matter if you have to wait for sluggish animations to come out or if it immediately knows the combat still feels on one hand too anime with certain weapons and really stilted and clunky with the majority of them the whole system seems as if they adjusted the bosses to operate on sekiro speed but the player is still playing a different game theres a mismatch unless you want to go through the game spamming magic or quickhound step most bosses level of agression seems to be balanced around bloodhound step and light no armour and obviously bleed status effects way too many enemies rely on spamming status effects even if you dodge you still get the status effect making it just annoying chip damage and a waste of time i understand why the majority of people cheese this game with bleed wapons or magic i just dont like using the path of least resistance only a small note to pvp its probably the worst in all of the souls games the game is wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle lots of empty space a pretty sky box but no actual worthwhile content strewn about if you see an item over there with a purple or orange glow and you thinks its worth fighting annoying enemies that ether spam attacks status effects you need to wait out before you can get close again or just eat boluses the item is never worth it in the overworld because its a crafting ingredient so rare youre not going to use anyways the whole crafting system seems like an afterthought its nice that you dont have to run back to buy arrows anymore and you can basically get them whenever youre not in a fight its still rather useless because ranged is not a viable option to play in these games enemy variety if you liked fighting the vanguard demon in demon souls and thought damn i really want to see this fat boy at every bigger tree i get close to then youre in luck the tree guardians are just the same model with a bit of a fire sage moveset the capra demon is back now just re skinned as an edgy butcher the moveset of other games enemies can be found completely recycled in er at least fromsoft is picking up trash and recyling it i guess the lesser random dungeons are plauged by the same issue you can encounter imps that are basically thralls from ds same movement just a different costume these stone watchdogs are being overused in these as well you can find them everywhere little to no variety at once or different added repeat monsters enemy placement this is the biggest blunder and i still cannot fathom why they would place a relevant story boss copy in an optional dungeon you cant really miss because the snow field has so little to offer that the few caves you find there are still a huge dissapointment astel is just randomly there my first time around i did they frenzied flame ending so i found him by exploring and it seemed out of place it was supposed to even be the harder version of this boss the night and day cycle is also a lot of wasted potential with the night its supposed to get harder yet hardly anything changes except from specific spots that re use the same bosses over and over death rite birds elmer fudd the failed rabbit hunter with a buggy sword hitbox and nigh infinite reach and the night cavalry this was also fromsofts main argument they gave when asked about ng+ changes the argument was that the night changes enough so they dont need to make changes for ng+ which just makes this game not interessting for people that like to have a switchup for higher ng+ cycles ds did it best changed enemies around and gave you a weapon that gets stronger the higher you are in ng+up to ng+ covenants lack there of lots of people enjoyed working for a reward covenant in previous games having different phantom colours gave people a goal which can be worked towards impatient people saw this as something they immediately wanted to have and did not like the long term passive task they could have improved so much on the multiplayer aspect but they already messed up the moundmakers in ds where it was intended on being a frenemy covenant but they ultimately did not commit to the possibilty of allowing people to be deceptive aka let the summon sign be also white instead of purple white more ambiguity over the summeds intentions would have created more tension more fun there are no area defense covenants only two types of invaders that have the same goal but ultimately you dont get a reward for it so theres no incentive to do so except disrupting the flow of someones game hence a large portion of the player base started using a mod that allows seamless co op just like lords of the fallen allows you to do no annoying summoning after beating a boss just co op fun many other games have improved upon systems fromsoft has so carelssly sidelined out of sheer incompetence by the management i dont think any developer in this company would oppose actual improvements story theres no story the game has a starting premise and basic world building with that i mean sticky notes on a fridge for you to pause and read this is by far the laziest they have gotten even though this formula seems to appeal to some people and basically puts bread on vaatis table its not good story telling the main principle of interactive media is show dont tell the game series always does the opposite all of the consequences in this game especially the endings are completely meaningless since they dont reflect anything in the game world besides a slightly differently tinged sky even lords of the fallen swaps out some enemies you encounter near the beacons when youre locked in one of three endings which is not a lot but at least they did something and they are a smaller team its severely overrated,Elden Ring

the games controls seem tailored for a controller and it shows when using a mouse and keyboard in a game this demanding intuitive controls are essential while everyone suggests playing with a controller its just not my style with gameplay success feeling locked behind a controller i cant recommend this game for those who prefer mouse and keyboard,Elden Ring
im completely new to elden rings and already dislike the controls thats my problem fact that theres no main story quest and its completely free roam type of mmorpg is also my problem thats just the game but like i spawned in found some type of ruin with low vls mobs so figured itdo that found a chest looted it was trapped and got teleported to a high lvl area i cant teleport to any way points so im literally just stuck here if i die i keep respawning in this area i cant leave it i cant even kill the normal mobs here because theyre way above my lvl or however strength is decided here its seriously f up,Elden Ring

many people out here already pointed out a mass amount of problems this game have briefly talking a major step back in comparison with sekiro just sad to see designers making probably the best visuals in the entire gaming industry only to be filled with poorly executed ingame mechanics updating once in years so the game wont look exactly the same as previous one especially in the dlc where game developers decides to make a firework ventilator out of every major boss there is,Elden Ring

love this game i purchased both on playstation and pc and i got every achievement in a week unfortunately i do not find myself enjoying the dlc as much as i was hoping i feel like the new damage negation system doesnt work like at all i have upgraded several times and can still get one hit by regular mobs i feel like they cheesed out on the difficulty not the attack patterns or anything they made every single mob hit like the elden beast and to me that makes no sense lets just hear that for a sec a normal ass mob in the middle of a field hits harder than radagon or the elden beast its really stupid there was no intro at all to the world apart from the advertisements online just go speak to lady and appear in new place kinda took a lot away form the experience of walking in the land of shadow for the first time maybe this has always been the way with souls games but after waiting for this many years i was hoping for a grander in terms of story as you dont really get much even from the main story you have to delve into every item in the game to really get any lore which i dont mind but i would like more from a dlc we have waited so long for its a damn pity i recommend the original game but the dlc does not seem worth it in my opinion,Elden Ring
the base game is amazing in my opinion the dlc however is terribly optimised and lackluster underwhelming is an accurate description play the base game but save yourself the money on the dlc and watch someone stream it,Elden Ring
i really like these games but the optimization is really bad from soft had this issue since bloodborne and still here we are in the heat of the battle you would love to have the most control you can but the first person shooter drops to because of the particles and volumetrics even if complete redesign of the engine is not in your business plan the solution still exists just add more options to graphic settings those having powerful cpu and ram will crank particles up others will do the opposite and its significantly worse in the dlc,Elden Ring
in a way this game is just like the first dark souls title from all those years ago and by that i mean its fun up today i learned around mediocre game and then the endgame is kind of lazy and not as goodwell thought out could be worse,Elden Ring
unfun game beat every boss no fun beat the game no fun beat every area no fun not skill issue no fun literally not entertaining or interesting,Elden Ring
over years in and they cant be bothered to fix frame ratedrop issues i have been playing er on inconsistent and poor frame rate for over hours but with later areas and bosses it becomes literally unplayable as my frames would drop to or as low as and then get back to ish rarely for a short period of time not only is it hard to play at first person shooter but the constant switching between somewhat smooth and miserable frames seriously throws me off after all the time in the world to fix this and i mean ive tried everything so at this point its the developers issue to fix not mine especially considering im easily not the only one with this issue,Elden Ring
shadow of the erdtree is great however i do not believe they spent enough time play testing the dlc bosses will shot you even with a lot of the new leveling system upgrades the bosses still shot me and they are very aggressive soim at a loss for words old hunters was very difficult but it felt justified for its difficulty this is just stupid the first bosses i come across just ruin the experience i beat rellana for your information and i did not have fun it felt cheap and notrewarding and it was not even required of me to do so from soft reduce the damage received in the dlc its stupid,Elden Ring
this is an arcade game cloaked in the pretty though not to me charade of aaa world design with a tinge of animelooking human characters here and there i am personally not a fan of japanese cartoons art style but said world feels lifeless and empty the story is so thin it makes dragons dogma and starfield look like they were written by coppola if an arcade style game where the purpose is to simply fight lesser mobs and bosses sounds fun to you youd like it the combat isnt interesting it has no real depth beyond learning boss patterns the same old thing going back to mario brothers in and rolling around and it has no visceral aspect or impact to it outside of causing people to rage if i want a semimindless game id rather play an arpg but thats me youre you and again if you like arcade fighting games this might be for you and for anyone wanting a game with a good story that has great challenging melee combat within a lively world i highly recommend kingdom come deliverance,Elden Ring
this is the worst game ever to have ever existed i dont understand how people can called this game the best game ever,Elden Ring
dont even bother going into new game plus if you are planning to play the dlc they made the game so unfair and like everyone has been complaining about you have to run to areas that everything one shots you to gather items so that things dont one shot you then you can play the game cause fromsoft thought that was a good mechanic and people in new game plus dont get to play cause they are too busy dying every five seconds,Elden Ring
super unfriendly as the bosses are way too aggresive and you cant even get a damage window,Elden Ring
makes me want to tear my eyes out but not in a good soulsborne way as i was exploring what i did of limgrave almost all my time playing it felt like a chore that granted me nothing except for one summon that trivialized margit after i leveled up mind to use it genuinely felt more difficulty trying to kill a giant on the way there if i wasnt on horse back feels like i need to sidequest and side track away from the brand new castle i unlocked just because i do close to the damage of a bee sting with a greatsword need to do around k damage for godrick every enemy in said castle doesnt provide enough souls to legitimately level up naturally going through it unless natural level up includes respawn farming or doing the side content that already wasnt giving me anything both in gameplay or feeling feel like the only person who doesnt like this game and keeps getting baited by replaying it thinking itll somehow feel better,Elden Ring
fuck this game and its devs big big pos,Elden Ring
genuinely unplayable i will never understand the appeal of a deceptively openworld but insanely linear game every enemy in the over world and a majority of the bosses are simply not fun and more so just annoying and feel like an obstacle and not in any slight of good way lore is shit and makes no sense even if you do watch some two hour video online about it every build is either boring andor feels like shit unless maybe my procks never ever ever hit everything is so inconsistent which makes the game hard for the sake of being hard and nothing else a vast majority of the bosses feel like a slog or a luck fest pvp is shit just unfair plain and simple optimization is abysmal playing on mediocre level settings on a pc is inconsistent at best exploration is hardly even that since you need a guide to anything and everything in the entire series i could not find something that this game does better than almost any other game to come out in the past few years and the win against god of war ragnarok was from people who conditioned themselves into thinking that the soulslike genre is good at all,Elden Ring
unable to play online inappropriate activity detected i assume its because of the linux but its deck verified so who knows,Elden Ring
cant have anal with melina bad game,Elden Ring
my h hours save file got corrupted after playing dlc,Elden Ring
game ran better at launch than now i do not know what they messed up with the updates but its full of stutters and first person shooter drops while exploring and in combat,Elden Ring
the dlc sucks they changed the leveling up system and made the boss times harder so it is almost impossible to level up it is glitchy as well sometimes when you try to do something it wont work if you are thinking about getting it wait and give them time to hopefully come to there senses and fix the crap,Elden Ring
the dlc and its bosses are not fun in the slightest there are performance problems hitching stuttering and lagging all of the issues that plagued the end of the base game are turned up to here i first played ds in and i think this will be the last game of the souls series that i play when considering the direction that the game design is heading,Elden Ring
shit fucking game dont buy it its really not worth it from software doesnt know how to make a good game and havent since bloodborne fuck this company fuck this game fuck this dlc and fuck you developers,Elden Ring
not easy to follow to figure out whats next if you like playing games where you have to look up a guide then i guess this is fun its like fantasy dora the explorer except no monkey with a map,Elden Ring
no longer works with bitdo pro controller,Elden Ring
they are not hiding the ball anymore just about every enemy reads your button presses there is a sincere devotion to making the game beautiful but at the same time giving you bosses with infinite movesets and proximity attack dances that can go infinitely at this point the developers just want to make the bosses as close to unbeatable as they can i sincerely regret buying the dlc,Elden Ring
inappropriate activity detected on steam deck linux + proton please hotfix as soon as possible p,Elden Ring
nowadays with the internet and everything being overly hyped by everyone including me sometimes its difficult to look at things for what they are so let me say a few things oh yeah i started the game as the developer intended however the difficulty is so unbalanced and bs that i modded the game to my needs my game my rules this game is from a niche genre where people enjoy difficulty for the sake of difficulty alone they dont care about storytelling and other conventions that make classic games masterpieces i bet that most souls players dont go around trying to figure the story out they just dont care they just want to fight the boss and make content and try to make money out of it this has to be said this game popularity is for its difficulty and for people to see streamers melting down hell even i am guilty of it sometimes with that said it doesnt make this game a masterpiece as many are claiming with the hype issue out of the way looking at the game alone there are great things about it such as art direction sound design level design creature design boss encounters just all great things to look at now when it comes to gameplay and storytelling i am sure that a souls player is reading this right now and screaming who the heck cares about story or character which is why i called it a niche game because the general public cares about story character development and other things that make a product a masterpiece it has to check all the boxes to be called that friend thats just how it is and dont tell me its impossible to check all the boxes because baldurs gate god of war the witcher zelda botw did it alright so its not a masterpiece its good for what it is now what are the boxes it doesnt check well the storytelling i wont even comment because the game itself doesnt care about explaining to me so why should i explain why i dont like it its non existent and dont tell me gorge rr martin was involved cause he did it for the money as he said himself video games arent art google its hilarious to hear haha hiring him was just a marketing stunt and worked last box it didnt check which is actually the most important gameplay i mean its a video game not a movie so it has to play well but even if it was a movie it would be a terrible one with this kind storytelling haha anyway the gameplay has sides one that works and the other which doesnt and i am looking at this comparing with the masterpieces i mentioned cause remember people are calling this one a greatest of all time so it should be judged as one what works the character moves well the weapon arts are cool animations and all the enemies animations are good for the most part what doesnt work the scaling leveling and difficulty i mean in a video game these are crucial i mean i am playing the witcher again and having a blast because the way the leveling experience is and the way it can be challenging at times that is whats missing in elden ring curated leveling experience and choices and the solution is not to add an easy mode because these kind of games once you adjust the leveling you break them in reality or they are ridiculously difficult or ridiculously easy and boring after you find an exploit than you have to spam the same attack over and over basically you have to find an exploit and use it over and over and this is a masterpiece the gameplay is so important in video games because this is how people will feel about your game that is why many classic games are classic because of the way they play and the genius behind them there is no genius in making players seeing the screen you died a million times hell i played stellar blade byonetta nier automata devil may cry and they feel great of course cheesy storytelling but they feel great to play elden ring looks way better than those games but playing experience is way worse in summary all they needed to do was to create a smart way for the player to need certain items to fight certain bosses according to their levels and explain it through great storytelling and i will gladly give a wonderful review and call it a masterpiece too but we all know it will never happen because of the power of hype and the amount of attention their games get just by punishing players that play this for content not having to spend millions in voice actors and mocap to tell a good story not having to balance areas in the game or in different difficulty settings just set everything to max difficulty by default and because of the loyal player base who think that most people like to sit down to play a video game and literally get headaches because the game difficulty is not well designed in the end dont kid yourself this isnt a masterpiece its a niche game that became popular by the power of internet hype i also can see people avoiding saying anything bad about elden ring because of the toxic player base and because they dont want to be seeing as a bad souls games player or something thats just so stupid,Elden Ring
the stuttering on pc is bad enough to where i would consider holding off if on mod to alleviate it existed one such mod does and i use it making performance essentially perfect except for traversal stutter between zones very rarely unfortunately most people on pc wont be aware of this mod on the nexus site or wont want to use it since it forces you to turn off eac and go offline only with no way to play online with the mod enabled from truly does need to look at this as the performance dips and stutters get bad enough to hamper game play even on the strongest of hardware setups that should never be the case for a big budget aaa game with the resources from should have access to now so its either them not caring or not knowing either way the performance is legitimately bad with no excuse to be honest if that doesnt bother you buy the game as its a classic in every other way if youre on the fence already the performance might ruin the experience for you,Elden Ring
does not have cross platform cross progression bought on pc for nothing,Elden Ring
i saw a roof with no lode bearing walls or posts as a fictitious contractor this upsets me dearly and pulled me right out of immersion terrible game would not recommend,Elden Ring
dlc is still broken can not login to server and usually crash when playing,Elden Ring
fuck this game and fuck souls game,Elden Ring
amazing game but just like everyone else is saying after years they still havent optimized this game or fixed the random stuttering i and many other people have high end pcs and are encountering the same problems either that or they cannot launch the game either way leading to hours of research only to find a million videos on how to solve these problems that shouldnt even be problems in the first place a million videos each having a different answer none reliable please fix this,Elden Ring
i would rather be public executed than play this game,Elden Ring
i enjoy the game but sometimes i want to play with a friend and if you want to play with a friend this is a shit game we have to kill like three invaders every time we play the dlc has turned on every monkeybrained metaplayer in the world to make the game unplayable without a spoonful of cheese i dont know who at fromsoft decided that the game was only going to tell you about invasions half the time but they need to be hit by a bus good game shit pvp system,Elden Ring
great world shit bosses id get it for running around and exploring not for fighting bosses,Elden Ring
performance is ass and the game stutters like crazy,Elden Ring
sekiro speed enemies with dark souls speed rolling not a good combination copy + paste bosses galore egregious input reading on frame broken pvp invasion matchmaking essentially killed pvp long ago worst souls game by from just go play dark souls if you want a good balanced experience,Elden Ring
fuck this game,Elden Ring
the ashe system has ruined the boss design the bosses of dlc are too fast and have too many nonstop combos for a player without ashe and it is very boring to challenge the boss with ashes my favorite boss is gaelhe is a badassafter i beat gael i feel i am a badass toobut the dlc bosses can not give me the same feelingafter a few hours of chanllagei only feel funnytired and meaningless i love souls gamesincluding er and hope it can be even better,Elden Ring
performance in the dlc is very inconsistent i had few issues with performance in the base game with an i k and rtx at p but the game is now randomly stuttering in one case the game froze for a full two seconds in the middle of a fight,Elden Ring
very fun game to play it can be hard at the start but it is enjoyable once you learn how to play it,Dota 2

rating dota the only game where youll experience all the stages of grief within a single match denial did that guy really just pick techies anger why did you feed again bargaining okay if we win this team fight i promise ill stop playing for today depression were minutes in and we havent even taken one tower and finally acceptance good game guys we tried its a magical place where friendships are tested sleep schedules are destroyed and every game feels like a phd in anger management ive learned more about teamwork strategy and how to silently scream in frustration than in any corporate teambuilding exercise but for every soulcrushing defeat theres that one glorious victory that makes it all worth it when the stars align and your teammates actually listen to pings and your carry doesnt decide to jungle until minutes in in short if you love stress yelling at strangers and the occasional eup,Dota 2

ah dota the epitome of gaming perfectionif by perfection you mean a roller coaster of frustration confusion and delightful toxicity lets dive into the sheer brilliance of this masterpiece first off the gameplay is a gem nothing says fun like spending minutes meticulously strategizing and farming only to have your efforts annihilated by one catastrophic teamfight the feeling of impending doom as you see your carefully laid plans crumble is just indescribably delightful the heroes are flawlessly balanced who doesnt love those nailbiting games where one hero becomes a walking apocalypse while the rest of the team watches in awe and despair its like playing on hard mode except you didnt sign up for it those graphics though the groundbreaking visuals from still shine in that nostalgic why does this game look like its from a decade ago kind of way and who needs constant frame rates when you can have that wonderful stutter during crucial moments it adds an extra layer of challenge really now the matchmaking system is where dota truly shines wait times that stretch into the length of a sitcom episode give you ample opportunity to contemplate life the universe and why youre still playing this game and being matched with teammates who possess the cognitive skills of a potato is just the icing on the cake every match feels like a thrilling lottery of whether youll get competent players or humanshaped lumpy rocks lets not forget the update schedule valves whimsical approach to patches keeps you guessing will they address critical bugs today or introduce a new hat instead the suspense is simply exhilarating and oh the community such a delightful mix of aggressive critics and unsolicited coaches its like a family reunion where everyones favorite pastime is questioning each others intelligence and reflexes the ingame chat offers a crash course in creative insults that should surely be studied by linguists in summary dota is an unparalleled experience that uniquely combines the joy of pulling your hair out with the excitement of wondering why youre still playing six out of five stress balls on the frustration scale highly recommended for masochists and those who enjoy an epic saga of pain and fleeting glory,Dota 2

theres an adage that the dota community often quotes when someone identifies themselves as a new player welcome to dota they say with open arms before concluding with you suck theyre not wrong for the first dozen hours or so youll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players but if you persevere dota becomes one of the most rewarding and tense teambased multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming its an achievement owed to uncompromising depth a ridiculously generous freetoplay model and the great features developer valve has built up around it,Dota 2

garbage boring game the only fun mode is turbo the basic game is so boring,Dota 2
terrible matchmaking if youve never played before dont start you will not have fun or progress the begginer mode will not allow you to progress in story line if you try to play matchmaking to progress everyone else will be a decade ahead of you in skill fun had too many sweats,Dota 2
years i have played this game cheaters and feeder never ever get punished valve does noting to stop themfew days ban and they continue,Dota 2
this game is so bad its only waste my time when a company make game cant handle smurf players make the game trash player with match play like a immortal player,Dota 2
i have not played long enough to recommend this game,Dota 2
i got abandoned while playing pls verify the game i was not away from keyboard laughing out loud dota sucks,Dota 2
i was quick selling my items then this steam wallet pending strikes me why do i have to wait fucking days for my money i was quick selling my items so i could buy another one from the market then this whatever the fuck this steam wallet pending shit is hold me from doing so and now im not able to purchase that sweet item,Dota 2
i payed hours this beta game and this trash game dont care about player gaben just want money money money money valve dont care about player matchmaking is everything in game is and they are focusing on skins their developer are not gamer and they dont know what to do they are just trash coding i hope dota going to dead game for ever so people are not going to waste their life like me on this trash game,Dota 2
roger throwing,Dota 2
matchmaking is unfair always gets match with griefer teammates altough i have k points,Dota 2
worst game ever,Dota 2
you know,Dota 2
match making sucks and will always give you an egoistic player that will cost you the game and also seasonal players that only play every time ti season starts to get free items play ranked matches and will look dumb because they didnt read the updates,Dota 2
i cant play online game like i get ban from server i test bot work fine i test other online game work fine,Dota 2
gameplay its good but i only can recommend the turbo version of the game because it ends fast if you want to play ranked be prepared to waste a lot of time unnecessarily because the game doesnt have a concede vote for some reason even though the game might be clearly over in some cases by minute you have to wait for another min for it to be really oversometimes even more if you leave youll be assessed with abandonment and you wont be able to play again for minutes this is just insane i have the paid version of the game which just gives you coins for cosmetics which i guess its fine because it aint expensive,Dota 2
okay so my review is relatively simple things happen and unfortunately you have to go afkabandon games timers are one thing and i have no issues with those however i am required to win single draft games the issue with this is that i am new to dota and am still unable to play new player mode so now i am required to get familiar with a completely random hero each match and ensure a win this is horrible i havent been able to get a single win after many games and wait times for one match has been averaging minutes edit i am still trying to get a single win i cannot even queue into the new player matches i have barely any games played but im having to play against people with thousands of wins this makes zero sense it has been two days of trying to even get a single win,Dota 2
ruined a friendship game is shit,Dota 2
love the base game but recently been addicted to several arcade games alot of them requires farming and the game needs to be running not having the option to farm while the computer takes a well needed rest is bs,Dota 2
i remember back then you can go crazy on those arcade mode since the skills kept changing and some are just batshit crazy but now no need for that since they kept changing the games map meta and skills welcome to h dota h,Dota 2
piece of shit i hope all developers will fell the pain all of players,Dota 2
the game has a lot of cheats to prevent people from progressing like wifi stops when playing dota it doesnt happen with any other game got full computer checked at support center no issues were identified in mother baord graphic driver wifi driver and so on issue happens only when playing dota multiple people have reported this but no resolution given from steam side,Dota 2
so freaking piss off about this game been encountering this glitches lately this month where the fog of war condition is making your map and view all to black and dark like when you dont have a vision of the area the whole map is like that you cant pick and ban a hero just wait for the time to up trees are not visible skills not highlighting which you dont freaking now if you have it in short it freaking unplayable and when you leave the game you get suspended valve fix this,Dota 2
you can enjoy your life < or you could play dota the choice is yours,Dota 2
i was facing establishing connection problem and nothing can help out of this trouble,Dota 2
boring waste of time,Dota 2
save yourself,Dota 2
its something to do,Dota 2
always crashed damn this game updated but always need to integrity files newly installed fucking game,Dota 2
soits a fun game but the community is toxic and unless youre playing against bots in a solo game this game induces a lot more rage and anguish then the fleeting pleasure it gives,Dota 2
will destroy your nights better invest time in your self,Dota 2
does not update sux,Dota 2
the biggest piece of shit in history,Dota 2
this sht ruined my life and i still continue to play it,Dota 2
report system is abusable cant ping teammates abilities items while explaining something to them >cant communicate in a hardcore competitive game,Dota 2
smoking is a healthier habbit than this,Dota 2
valve cant you just make a fixed camera option on hero instead of fuckin holding a button that is bullshit thats like missing the breaks on a racing sim wft this game is unplayable for me some players dont like to pan around so many settings and you forgot the player fixed cam on click really game would be nice looks good fights feel good but this is unaccaptable uninstalled and not playing again,Dota 2
it is time hours and i think i am ready to admit there were indeed idiots in every game not i have a million negative things to say about this game the new pathfinding algorithm matchmaking and so on but the absolute rotten state of the community takes the top spot its not fun anymore,Dota 2
keeps disconnecting its terrible,Dota 2
give me arcana first,Dota 2
so much lag and banning when its their server problem,Dota 2
so toxic griefing,Dota 2
this game was fun when i first played it but when i left new player mode and started playing the actual game everything changed the balancing is horrible the community is toxic matches take minutes and it takes leaving a match very seriously if you leave a match you need to wait minutes before you can play again and you need to win matches in a game mode where it chooses random heroes and you can only play those heroes it does not matter if you lose times in a row in that game mode you have to win to get to play normally again,Dota 2
no control of smurfs impossible to play and learn also rewards are super lame and costs ton of money big no disgusting community,Dota 2
i personally do not recomend the game its full of bots cheaters also that can see freely on map its a plain old game thats not worth to waste hour per match even if you got afks theres no surrender option very disgusting,Dota 2
bad game,Dota 2
toxic behavior once identified shouldnt account the other teams mmr if someone intentionally feeds to loose the entire penalty is not fair to other players,Dota 2
matchmaking is bs if you are a new player < matches you will always play in team with the players < matches and against the team where all players are > matches when the patch fixes the bugs and balances the heroes the other patch brings more bugs and makes everything unbalanced again,Dota 2
this game is fun but you will loose ur sanity,Dota 2
raping dota as much as they could good job with this unbalanced shit,Dota 2
toxic russians matchmaking isnt fair you get teamed up with people with less than k hours while having over k hours,Dota 2
there is a lot of toxic player in game now they dont respect other peoples time to relax by playing this game,Dota 2
this will drain your soul you will lose your family friends and possible your life due to how addictive its,Dota 2
cant log in only up to the loading screen when you open dota,Dota 2
hope to see you loss profit soon,Dota 2
game has become unplayable over the years due to developer negligence,Dota 2
the geam is cool but again and again i have missing skin sets,Dota 2
dota review a deep dive into the world of competitive gaming introduction dota developed and published by valve corporation is a staple in the world of competitive gaming since its release in it has captivated millions of players globally with its intricate mechanics diverse hero pool and intense strategic depth however like any major title dota has its share of strengths and weaknesses particularly when it comes to its community gameplay dota offers a highly complex and rewarding gameplay experience each match is a v battle where players select from over heroes each with unique abilities and playstyles the games depth comes from the need for strategic planning precise execution and teamwork learning curves are steep but the satisfaction of mastering a hero or pulling off a wellcoordinated strategy is immense graphics and sound the game features detailed and visually appealing graphics each hero is distinct and the various skins and cosmetics add a personalized touch to the characters the sound design is topnotch with impactful sound effects and immersive music that enhance the overall experience community the dota community is one of the most passionate and dedicated in the gaming world but it also has a reputation for being notoriously difficult to navigate the competitive nature of the game often leads to highstress environments and new players can find themselves overwhelmed not only by the games complexity but also by the harsh criticism from more experienced players toxicity is a welldocumented issue within the community ranging from verbal abuse in chat to intentional gamethrowing while valve has implemented various measures to curb negative behavior it remains a significant problem on the flip side the community is also home to some of the most knowledgeable and skilled players in esports there are countless resources available from detailed guides and tutorials to streamers and professional players who are willing to share their insights the dota subreddit and various forums are active hubs for discussion strategysharing and general gamerelated content competitive scene dota boasts one of the most lucrative and prestigious competitive scenes in esports highlighted by the international an annual tournament with prize pools often exceeding tens of millions of dollars the competitive scene is vibrant and offers numerous opportunities for aspiring players to make a name for themselves updates and support valve consistently updates dota with new heroes balance changes and events while some updates can be controversial and lead to temporary discontent within the community the developers commitment to evolving the game keeps it fresh and engaging conclusion dota is a masterpiece of competitive gaming offering deep strategic gameplay that can keep players engaged for thousands of hours however the community can be a doubleedged sword offering both a wealth of knowledge and a potentially toxic environment for those willing to invest the time and effort dota can be an incredibly rewarding experience but newcomers should be prepared for a challenging journey chatgbt said in the nicest way that the community sucks,Dota 2
dont start for the love of god dont,Dota 2

legue is better in dota i dont now what the fuck im doing its crazy the tf are so crazy and the abilities are so op i will not recommend this game if you play legue of legends,Dota 2
waste of time new facets update is stupid since the game was already lowkey unbalanced in some ways made it even more unbalanced and matches are boring and repetetive everyone just picks wk wd ck and thats about it mmr algorithm is rigged to keep you at your rank if you get a win streak you will be matched with worse players or matched against smurfs since they dont want you to rank up too fast many heroes are irrelevant despite the game having over heroes people just pick the same or that are absolutely broken this patch,Dota 2
need dedicated to region lock servers for ccp,Dota 2
the only game with more russians than cs a swam of cockroaches,Dota 2
completely waste of time dont really enjoy it,Dota 2
dota is getting worse by the day ive played for thousands of hours i know the new reporting system is so trash that if you play with toxic players you get all reports which pool you with more toxicity and the cycle never ends you pay for dota+ and then your chat and voice lines get timed and banned i will not renew my subscription again the maps are now pay to unlock and so on half the cost of an arcana to get an immortal and a few rewards dota does not take your skill level into account they match people with k plus hours with people who just joined the result> newbies just get frustrated coz of low skill and disrupt games over game quality is lower than ever overall recommendation to new people,Dota 2
youll be lag even your net is stable so dont play this game,Dota 2
if you are enjoying life too much and need a pickme down play dota,Dota 2
waste of time the mmr concept will not allow good players to move ahead besides retaining your rank for eternity you will be played with players who will make our life more stressful,Dota 2

as a new player trying to learn the game the dota tutorial is absolute bottom tier garbage trash tutorial the fact that everything is separated into many different parts instead of being smooth and condensed is bad the first tutorial is actually broken in that if you arent in range if the tower dies the tutorial doesnt end the game tries to be cute with intro cinematics which add nothing of value and only pad the time it takes to get into learning the game doesnt explain tower mechanics in the first tutorial i dont get how the dota team expects new players to join the game,Dota 2
i cant play =,Dota 2
very bad game,Dota 2

so many bug and smurf player in rank,Dota 2
game is just like a mango because first bite tastes bitter then after it tastes sour and those who can digest the sourness can adjust according to the taste but then the time finally comes and it becomes sweeter in taste and hence the mango becomes the most addicted fruit for all fruit lovers,Dota 2
sht game and sht community support for defending dumb ass players,Dota 2
this game will ruin ur life,Dota 2
the most unskill game design i ever have saw every champ have point click abilities and every champ have somekind of cc ability stun sleep this game is about who have bigger range on their abilities or who have blink dagger item thanks to which you can blink half of your monitor to your opponet and oneshooted them and they can do sht about that skill just blink and kill hole gameplay this game dont know what balance is or better said if every champ is unbalance then all champ is balance thats is design behind this game i regred every minute i was trying to like this game but not it is peace of garbage for kids with not arms,Dota 2
terrible in windows wont play it again rd abbandon in a row because game crashes and then verify game integrity f off,Dota 2
i used to love this game then i became sober and started touching grass women,Dota 2
cluttered and unclear ui no way to surrender no tutorial for new players if your teammates leave the game and then you leave the game youre stuck in purgatory mode with even worse players and no way to escape and the game has unnecessarily complicated game design that feels like its stuck in the year with the blocky d models and lifeless characters with names like shooter or knight,Dota 2
worst matchmaking everand patches make no senseyou patch a gameadd neutral items and of players in unrakned dont know how to use neutral,Dota 2
game has to have the absolute worst matchmaking i have ever seen it is not even the ranks and such that is the issue it is the amount of players on this game that have skill issues there are people in games with others who have no business playing in certain brackets you can never progress because they continuously bring you down dont waste your time with this game toxic community trash matchmaking and massive skill issues with players,Dota 2

this game ruined my life i recommend everyone to play dota and not laughing out loud nor mobile legends dont get me wrong i am not hating or anything i was from dota for like years before dota was released and it didnt caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it dota is a great game an awesome game i really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it i say mechanics are well designed what makes a hero op is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it this is a team game people so team work is a must unless you are solo queuing then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around monster gamers are real dota has taught me a lot of things you can only be good at something if you focus on it learn from mistakes be aware of your surroundings trust your instinct use common sense trusting on your team to always have your back believing in your capabilities always try to be better than you were yesterday and that the comebacks are real this game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds a mere game that brings people together not just friends but complete strangers too dota is a game that will never be forgotten all in all i recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain suffering and torment because at the end you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better postscript calm down its just a game yawa,Dota 2

a joke of a game no matter how long i have played it i never really enjoyed any part of the game since the beginning years ago only played it because of social reasons controls and gameplay feel like a playing with a broken leg every minute of the match is painful and feels like a pointless slog there soo many other better games out there that is worth playing more rather than this game atleast in other games you feel like having fun while playing this is literally torture winning in this game doesnt even feel like winning it feels like you just when through a super annoying ride to a destination which wasnt worth the time and effort,Dota 2

new players are matched with experienced players with thousands of games played i only played games,Dota 2
shit community full of assholes on casual,Dota 2
for me this game has many issues and has lost its way over the years the game is also a reflection of the developer in this case has also lost their way first the game i have played this game for around years on and off while it was not always this way i can say the community is one of the most toxic communities i have ever witnessed every single game you might just need to mute all players it has gotten to the point that many recommend muting all every time the matchmaking somehow has gotten to an unplayable state especially in a party of any size in addition the support for the game seems to be in an identity crisis and the direction of the game and pro scene seem lost which brings me to the developer valve has lost its way they continue to sabotage the pro scene theyre taking more and more away from the community and pro players and giving more to themselves see ti vs ti prize pool and years before as well keep in mind this company makes more profit per employee than most large tech companies including apple microsoft and more this is public information knowing this their community market is riddled with stolen items that valve then profits on resells in the market this is wildly unethical and predatory what makes it worse is they refuse to help a player in need and go after the scammers accepting the profits from stolen goods being traded yes after years of being a loyal customer with valve and giving them thousands of dollars i was hijacked only one time and lost dota items the issue here is years ago they would help players in need for a time deal now they have no care at all zero while my own actions caused my issues i believe this company i used to love is horrible and unethical now and only cares for money i believe it is represented in this game for those reasons i can not recommend too long i did not read the game has become one of the most toxic games ive ever experienced in over years of all my gaming plus valve is constantly sabotaging it for their own greed there are so many lawsuits on them currently from other developers to players in the uk i can not recommend supporting a toxic game made by greedy devs,Dota 2
game always freezing cant connect to a game after accepting a match and getting banned for longer and longer when this happens even though its their fault,Dota 2
too many bots dont play,Dota 2

its a game that eats you all the time i have over k games played no matter how well you play you find idiots who ruin your game and you have nothing to dodislikes and reports they dont produce any effect and whatever you do you cant find players to play their roles the idea is that until something is done about it its not worth playing you only get frustrated and angry,Dota 2
update your game players are fucking trash full of throwers,Dota 2

match making is trash they prioritize matching speed over actually fun balanced games you suck valve,Dota 2

man this community is toxic,Dota 2
really shitty broken game with horrible characters and the players are awful too,Dota 2
fire your new set of developers please if you want to keep this game alive like literally they have destroyed the game for the last years also those who have made new conduct rules those are the most stupid and dumbest people to exist in this world and might be losers in real life that dont want to adapt anything and just stay silent on their miserable existence i remember when people could say anything they want to anyone in the game and still wont get their conduct decreased until someone reports them and now its a shit show you type something in the chat to your teammate that is delibrately feeding the enemy team because he is less skillful he mutes you continues to feed and you get muted for the whole game even if you are on the top networth of your team and playing wonderfully well you still get muted like who the hell makes stupid rules like this i swear if i find that losers email address i am gonna show him full videos of losers like him that are playing the game and mentally causing distress to others losing is one thing but feeding and not listening and then muting other players over it wont get you banned but typing something in team chat to convince someone to play better and guiding him will get you banned just fuck your new developers fucking losers stupid idiots low lifers,Dota 2

not for beginners so many people who should get permament ban but dont it is annoying,Dota 2

if you are years old you would like this game,Dota 2
valve released a patch that introduced a ton of bugs ability draft shame,Dota 2
shitty game with stupid people no matter how calm and good my behaviour is this game forces me with teammates who are shit at this game and grief intentionally this causes me to rage every now and then and i am reported because of this it makes no sense whats the point of good behaviour stupid game with an improper reporting system wont recommend ever league of legends is better,Dota 2

infested with russians,Dota 2
bad game,Dota 2
very bad matchmaking,Dota 2
as toxic as ever d,Dota 2
just muted so you will get a better life and reported,Dota 2
dota s ranked matchmaking is notoriously frustrating frequently placing players on teams destined to lose due to poor balance good play is often met with unjust reports and penalties while toxic teammates and clueless players make the experience even worse being trapped in hourlong matches with no hope of a comeback amplifies the agony turning what should be an exciting challenge into a demoralizing ordeal youve been warned,Dota 2
great game but its bugged af and steam doesnt do anything about it of the time i get booted out of que after accepting a game then i get a hour ban complete waste of time,Dota 2
as a game its good i also had a lot of fun playing it at times but i just cant recommend playing it the community is toxic the game takes forever to learn and isnt fun to do so just so many better things you can do with your time,Dota 2
i use to play this game religiously for years i just recently stated playing again after a couple years gone i got punished for leaving a a game that was a stomp they put me in a low priority que i waited over hour and still no games that is not how you treat costumers you wanna keep no game should have wait times of even min let alone over an hour i will deleteing for good goodbye,Dota 2

this game turn to a trash scammer game you pay for dota plus and when a match found it write game is ideal but when you accept it you will see noob trash accbuyer toxic grifer players so guys dont pay anything for this scam plus sht + game have algoritm it dont let you rank up it keep you in specefic mmr because alot of players left this game and their player is very low they do it for that because they want players in herald guardiand and all lower mmrs so when you get mmr match making put toxic low skill players in your team and bossters smurfs and high skill players in enemy team so you will loss all mmr who you get before so you cant rank up solo i hope be helpful this review for you guys,Dota 2
probably the only game they care about,Dota 2

wow i am a newbie at dota i was dominating in the practice games and i thought ok i got this i just loved it then tried unranked games wow if you arent an expert level you get crushed immediately over and over and over again it isnt fun because everyone else is so skilled you get completely demolished literally as soon as someone shows up next to you you just spend most the game just waiting around not to be dead again i am so disappointed because i had so much fun during the many practice games,Dota 2
this is thoroughly one of the worst games i have ever played from balancing to ui layout other platforms offer much more with way less headache if you like this game good for you may your life one day be stress free from this game,Dota 2
toxic community bad matchmaking and punishment system plus the game is full of smurf accounts and boosters not recommend at all,Dota 2

this game will reveal to you your iq and you will feel sad play hots or whatever that other one button phone moba is and live in denial of your lack of braincells,Dota 2
i used to play this game because it really reminded me of the old dota from warcraft but now on a lot seems way much different i really miss the old days of of this game so much simpler so if you are a new player or an old moba veteran then this might be a tuff game to learn and you may need several hours to learn how things works,Dota 2
fucking pice of shit garbage game zero bitches play this and bitches that do prob ugly,Dota 2
unplayable but i had a great time with bugs,Dota 2
trash game server refuses to connect and if you dont connect in few seconds then you get panelty of mins and that increases and if it happens times then you have to play low priority matches where you cant even choose a hero im glad i left this trash a year ago now i can finally leave this toxic shit filled with toxic people behind,Dota 2
game is dogsht if you want to play a game like this go for league of legends would rather play that game,Dota 2
is a trash update trying to recreate the game because ofwhat exactly this is the least balanced this game has ever been and attempts to improve it have failed miserably a single update should not result in a near win rate reduction for one here but here we are want to improve this game valve words region lock,Dota 2
dota matchmaking is a complete enemies with more than k hours and on my team yearold children who when i tell them something claim to have had sex with my mother,Dota 2

in game keep spike after restart pc then showing keep downloading content,Dota 2
new version is unbalanced very disorienting to older players who dont have the time to learn how to abuse the new changes slow down the radical revisions and make the game balanced,Dota 2
literally why even play a moba in,Dota 2

bad matchmaking system join a game in sec and doesnt fill team good luck,PUBG Battlegrounds

used to be a good game back when it released and into eventually it started pandering to the typical fortnite battlepass type player went fp while doubling down on microtransaction bs the performance somehow got worse and was infested with cheaters its seriously sad to see what this game has become what the hell happened,PUBG Battlegrounds
toxic hacks stupid maintenance times during peak hour na,PUBG Battlegrounds
still riddled with hackers,PUBG Battlegrounds
many update update take many time update in us prime time,PUBG Battlegrounds
its so bad the guns suck and map,PUBG Battlegrounds
why would you keep updating this horrible game the game barely loads title screen when your supposed to be choosing a place to land you end up on the other side of the map and times out of you die in the storm the game is garbage and the servers should be shut down the micro transactions are very intrusive and annoying and no matter how good you do even if you earn it you still have to use real money to get anything overbearing and a waste of time an money i give it a out of,PUBG Battlegrounds
way to many updates with no thought into timing do not waste your time,PUBG Battlegrounds

cheaters rule the game,PUBG Battlegrounds
get temp bans and bans for absolutley no reason and then suddenly get unbanned,PUBG Battlegrounds
the game has too many errors the physics of the game is too bad the flash thrown outside into the room of the person outside is flashed,PUBG Battlegrounds
in game currencies=bad also am kill all time,PUBG Battlegrounds
new jeans too spenny,PUBG Battlegrounds
too many players with autoaim hacks unlimited fire hacks and damage reduction hacks making this game near unplayable loved the game when created like the updates to a certain degree but the lack of anticheat management leaves it wanting more monitoring and action is needed,PUBG Battlegrounds
banned for using crosshair nowhere mentioned in the eula against this this is ridiculous this not just deprives me of playing this but leaves a game ban on my profile,PUBG Battlegrounds
just thing for this game that is cheater everywhere cheater nest,PUBG Battlegrounds
its still to hard for beginners,PUBG Battlegrounds
opened once now i am stuck in the empty lobby screen with no menus,PUBG Battlegrounds
miss when this game was based off realism,PUBG Battlegrounds
meh best gunplay of any game though,PUBG Battlegrounds
the worth update ive seen there were a beautiful game how you can make it a peas of shit,PUBG Battlegrounds
unplayable in south america very few players bots barely any fpp matches and no solo fpp mode microtransaction hell full of silly skins and outfits that ruin the vibe of the game lame collaborations mostly kpop bands most inventory items skins outfits and so on that used to be marketable on steam can no longer be sold or traded optimization is awful a pc that can comfortably run god of war cyberpunk and metro exodus on high settings struggles to run pubg on its lowest at p maybe the planned transition to unreal engine and mods can save the game otherwise dont bother unless youre in europe or asia north america is in a sorry state too pubg used to be the battle royale game i had hundreds of hours across platforms and accounts now in it is merely a shadow of its former self the soulless husk of a fallen titan that refuses to die despite being halfrotten already,PUBG Battlegrounds
somehow im still playing with this poopoo the only good thing about this game is that it is super basic but its buggy laggy does not respect players time inconsistent with gameplay rules does not have a map selector still anticonsumer promotes toxic player behavior with different game rules and mechanics the publisher does not care about this game at all only the money if you want to have a happy life skip this game i cannot play the game due to a programming error when searching for values you are not taken to a game hall,PUBG Battlegrounds
would be as good as any other game if you didnt have to run for mins to zone just to find a medkit while ur horsepower fucking game,PUBG Battlegrounds
i came back to this game after years and i see just like the war we lost to the chinese and now this game caters to all of asias audience,PUBG Battlegrounds
lag as hell,PUBG Battlegrounds
cheating is a huge problem currently dont get why people want to cheat frustrated if you cheat they should bandeletelock your steam account then you can lose the money spent on all your games as you dont deserve to be part of a gaming platform,PUBG Battlegrounds
they ban you for anything even if your not hacking,PUBG Battlegrounds
too buggy and laggy dx dont fully support yet dont expect high expectations in terms of optimization,PUBG Battlegrounds
please optimize this game so it would run smoothly even medium settings on a gtx lags while in epic games pubg runs much more smoother on ultra settings with low cpu usage and low temps please fix cpu and gpu bottleneck errors on steam pubg as soon as possible,PUBG Battlegrounds
most inoptimized game,PUBG Battlegrounds
this game has gone from being the king of battle royales to a den of toxic cheaters with high levels once this game amazed us with nice graphics dynamics physics but today it is hell for any player if he is not a nerd of this game do you want to win a match you will be the th the th the th the th the th the th but never the first because in each match are from to players of level and above these players play like gods with perfect movement perfect choice of weapons perfect loot perfect shooting i highly doubt that they are clean still want to try to play this game try it but i warned you,PUBG Battlegrounds
a player unknowns battlegrounds process has crashed we apologize for the inconvenience please provide detailed information to help us track down and fix this crash,PUBG Battlegrounds
terrible anymore went from being the greatest of all time to being the worst,PUBG Battlegrounds
bro so many incompatibilities happening like the frequent crashing and always wanting to verify files even though everything has been verified minutes ago,PUBG Battlegrounds
im not entirely sure as to what or why but i feel like controls are broken aim and ads having a holdtoggle option if im in st person are unusable it makes me tap the button and glitches the view like times before it finally takes it away with similar issues in rd person im not sure how a game like pub is having issues like this with how long its been out never had the issues on mobile also no controller support on pc really i know this game is on postscript and xbox cmon now,PUBG Battlegrounds
cant hear the footsteps,PUBG Battlegrounds
except for cheaters csgo is better in every way thats my opinion,PUBG Battlegrounds
i fucking suck at this game,PUBG Battlegrounds
worst game ever created,PUBG Battlegrounds
what a shame what this game became hadnt played it for years but obviously there was a reason for that i guess they just steal your data now too ontop of poor performance and hackers yeah save yourself the time dont download this,PUBG Battlegrounds
was good now shit they dont care about cheaters,PUBG Battlegrounds
broskis added bots into the game and made the ui look like a mobile game wouldnt recommend,PUBG Battlegrounds
i press play on this game and it takes way too long to launch,PUBG Battlegrounds
i think the game developers are pedophiles they have these year old looking asian girls dancing and singing on a screen on some stage before each match its crazy a lot of the skinsclothing you can get are all perverted looking too it just doesnt go with the game its creepy i uninstalled it weirdos,PUBG Battlegrounds

shitty gameplay and lots of cheaters better play pubg mobile personally i get there much more fun and better stats,PUBG Battlegrounds
lots of bugs lots of cheaters game changing resolution without me doing it and other stuff like that this game needs to be fixed to even be playable,PUBG Battlegrounds
asia server here + hours you can play rounds with bots per day and you will get some kills after that be ready to suffer from pros cheaters and broken mechanics of this garbage,PUBG Battlegrounds
uninstall the moment you install it trust me,PUBG Battlegrounds
was decent years ago but the game hasnt changed in any positive or meaningful way other than being free now still its seemingly full of cheaters that dont face any real punishment bot games are the only solace but even those are limited their focus is on bs like crossovers with shitty corps instead of making the game more fluid seriously after playing a new age shooter and coming back to this i did a double take,PUBG Battlegrounds
everybody in this game is cheating these days,PUBG Battlegrounds
just play fortnite or warzone or apex,PUBG Battlegrounds
i do not recommend this game for anyone until the developers tighten the grip on cheaters within three games ill have at least one cheater or an entire team of people cheating in my lobbies this needs to be fixed fast,PUBG Battlegrounds
if youre feeling nostalgic about battle royale games this isnt the way to relive them,PUBG Battlegrounds
every friend i try to add says no user found,PUBG Battlegrounds
its worse than it was when it first came out even though theyve polished it it should be a paid game to mitigate cheaters but naw they gotta sell their k pop skins the mongoloids updating this game prioritize pointless music in the beginning that crashes the game but let cheaters take over the game if you used to play dont come back and dont ever give them money for skins youre a grown adult what are you buying that crap anyways,PUBG Battlegrounds
game fucking sucks you pick squads and it puts you in a fucking game alone hello i fucking picked squads give me a god daamn fucking teammm mm mmmmmm,PUBG Battlegrounds

full of cheaters,PUBG Battlegrounds
game is good but its incredible how many cheaters there are especially during the day even if you sucessfully detect them they only get banned for a weak when they perma ban them they just make a new acc and same shit all over again this company did nothing to make it more consequential if you cheat in the end all they get is a bloody slap on the wrist with a promise that they won t do it again,PUBG Battlegrounds

way to jank to enjoy has a lot of serious problems maps are way too big graphics and optimisations terrible looks and feels like a mobile game also has a lot of cheaters easy anticheat is incredibly easy to bypass only redeeming factor of this game is the realistic weapon choices with customised attachments which i appreciate considering other major br have goofy guns,PUBG Battlegrounds

worst optimization ever runs like dogshite on highend pc,PUBG Battlegrounds
not optimized in what the fuck shit mm movement janky asf gunplay doesnt feel satisfying even its free doesnt mean you have to play,PUBG Battlegrounds
title pubgs disappointing descent into a freak show as a longtime fan of pubg i am deeply frustrated and disappointed with the direction this game has taken what once was a gritty intense survival battle royale has now devolved into an absurd carnival of pink bunny costumes and a rainbow atmosphere pubg started with a clear vision a realistic highstakes battle where survival depended on strategy and skill the adrenaline rush of being the last one standing in a harsh environment was what drew me in but now that essence is completely lost the game is now a freak show cluttered with bizarre inappropriate content that clashes with its original spirit seeing players in garish pink bunny outfits feels like a slap in the face to those of us who cherished pubgs realistic survivalist roots this whimsical cartoonish aesthetic is not what i signed up for moreover the frequent collaborations with childish girl bands only make it worse instead of teaming up with brands that align with pubgs intense atmosphere the developers seem intent on chasing trends that have no place in a game that once prided itself on mature brutal gameplay its disheartening to see a game with so much potential lose its way so dramatically the developers focus on adding superficial content instead of enhancing the core gameplay experience is a huge misstep pubg no longer feels like the game i fell in love with it feels like a cheap desperate attempt to appeal to a broader audience until the developers remember what made pubg greatits authenticity intensity and true survival battle royale experienceits hard to see a future for this game that doesnt involve more frustration and disappointment,PUBG Battlegrounds
where is balance im level and playing against lvl + players its not fair nd game wants to buy buy buy buy what the fuck i just downloaded overall game is shit,PUBG Battlegrounds
worse fortnight can only play so many games in a day goofy animations,PUBG Battlegrounds
nothing gets you immersed in battle like a adult man running around in daisy dukes and a pink cowboy hat,PUBG Battlegrounds
worst game even after making this game free there are all the lobbies are full of hackers who hacks blatantly not even getting a single ban,PUBG Battlegrounds
just watched the new promo video and i gotta say are these devs genuinely on crack or something who the hell put kawaii marketing ahead of fixing bugs on the list of priorities tf game is trash,PUBG Battlegrounds
its better for developer to optimise game cause its one of the worst game when we talk abouth optimization first person shooter fly from to randomly all they do is addin more stupid stuff to sell and take money,PUBG Battlegrounds
it was ass got the game to get new jeans skin found out i had to sink over + to get a guaranteed skin ass game ass company stan new jeans,PUBG Battlegrounds

the publisher does not care about this game at all only the money sadly becoming more and more clear,PUBG Battlegrounds
how the mighty has fallen,PUBG Battlegrounds
garbage joke of a game let it burn but while there are still those with the attention span and needs of toddlers they will keep farming out rubbish to try and promote it sheeesh some generic group of korean robots who rely on synthesized voice are now promoting this game embarrassing they are literally applying the toddler logic of stick a picture of peppa pig on a bag of st and the kids will want it although to be fair the korean robots have a lot less talent than peppa pig,PUBG Battlegrounds
no controller support no cross progression i think pubg has cross platform but not sure since i dont play this game on pc and no longer have postscript need to get with the times pubg all the time effort and money spent on my postscript account i would probably play this game if it had controller support though,PUBG Battlegrounds
eewww>>>>>> they ruined the pubgs legacy once and for all im happy that ive stopped playing all this crap if you want to earn only money then do business sell weed to people that will help with your financial crisis promoting k pop will not please stop destroying the name of some legendary game pubg was one of them good bye pubg,PUBG Battlegrounds

based ttrd gng was hour,PUBG Battlegrounds
its simply not worth your time and the devs actively ignore the oppressive amount of cheating in their game ive hard rumors that bans are only days long not a good look,PUBG Battlegrounds

krafton ruined a good game in this game was playable now its super laggy you cant pick what map you want to play on this game is now a kpop sell out,PUBG Battlegrounds
the issue is the player base there are a lot of idiots who dont understand teamwork dont have a mic or communicate at all or just straight up steal your vehicleloot if you kill a teammate who hasnt communicated at all but randomly decides to steal your vehicle or shoot out your tires you get banned but they dont the punishment for cheating is a temp ban usually even a perma ban doesnt matter because cheaters literally just create a new steam account and are in the game again takes minutes hardware bans would solve this issue but they need all the players they can get to fill lobbies,PUBG Battlegrounds
highly not recommended,PUBG Battlegrounds
this game used to be awesome then they sold their souls and lost their way dont be like pubg,PUBG Battlegrounds
i will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards thank you > フ | l ` ミxノ | ヽ ノ │ | | | ̄| | | | | ̄ヽヽ 二つ,PUBG Battlegrounds

do you want hotfixes do you want a game without cheaters how about promotion and advertising of crap enjoy,PUBG Battlegrounds
technically the worst game ever made the devs cannot optimize this game so it runs at least without any crashes the game is full of crap that could be updated years ago the <esc> hotkey button you decided to add it after like years ago after the games initial release well done keeping stuff that just make sense for some future updates so that you can actually give functionality to this piece of crap the clans you decided to introduce them after years holy fuck you are a head krafton good job keep that spirit up okay the donate policy and redeem codes policy is a pure crap you give out gcoins for a limited amount of time are you fucking idiots i get how how much you say fucking gcoins for a week that i cannot spend on anything in your fucking overpriced store no god please no i am not gonna donate to this shithole anymore i already paid for likу battle passes in the past including this account okay your stupid collaborations skins and whatever make no sense with your damn chinese events the game is unplayable every single time me and my friends go back to lobby we suffer the lobby cancer let me explain every single of us four have to find out whose lobby lagged and needs to be restarted otherwise we wont be able to launch the game because even if you see on your client that yellow damn mark it doesnt mean its there on other players why the fuck do we have to fuck around every time we lose a fast dead pochinkipower grid game that was loading for ages just to load an another one and suffer even more in summary i played this game over hours and i know what im talking about this was a fun game to play i was so excited when i first launched it in september and started playing real hard since then it was a shithole with constant crashes probably because i was having windows and with those lobby lags those infinite loading screens ahhhhhh if your internet sometimes fails you that gonna suck you will get disconnected from the game entirely it will offer you uwu owo you can reconnect to the match just press that button but dont be fooled i tried that shit many times and in of the cases it wasted my time just leave the fucking lobby and pray that you wont be killed during that time of your reconnect kinda makes me think everything makes you waste your time and do the game records for that damn company booo look my players spend too many hours in my games too many hours sitting and waiting in lobbies loading screens imagine how bad your game must be you implement a fucking tool to uncrap your multiplayer lobby just to play with your friends fucking pathetic the cheaters situation isnt so bad though but you might find some around and its fine just report them and they likely will be banned i do not recommend playing this game and im happy that i stopped playing it months ago i came back literally yesterday played a bit then downloaded an update and it became like times worse this game not worth your time but if youre the new player i highly recommend you to take a look at it and play at least hours and see for yourself the game is sometimes nice and thats why i sticked around for that much but in the state like this id rather play genshin impact and eat hoyoverses crap or having vanguard virus installed on my computer that scans my private shit right riot games and damn valorant,PUBG Battlegrounds
shitty servers and always crashing for no reason,PUBG Battlegrounds

in old days you could play on eragnel when you wanted no random map bullshit forget that but now if you directly want eragnel you have to play with bots game says so and only times a day but oh what about awesome random map choice where wow you have a chance to play eragnel well even more fucking bots hooray this is what we want right being forced to play a random map of not our choice and also playing with bots bbut what about ranked is it safe no you need to pay a subscription to play ranked so pubg didnt become free it actually got x times more expensive since hey guys you need to pay to even enjoy a balanced game because my first game i got killed by a level + on my first come back of this game isnt that fun if you want a good pubg experience as much as this hurts to say play pubg mobile at least there they dont steal you ip address and pc info and your location and your account info guys and there you can play eragnel as much as you want you pick it,PUBG Battlegrounds

literal garbage still living in the past no changes same shit game who in the right mind thought team killing in a fing battle royale was a good idea and game design theres a reason why all battle royales who copied pubg its pretty much all of them changed these dumb decisions of game design fortnite had team killing once and it was bad i have no idea why people keep playing this shit its not worth beeing in top steam games,PUBG Battlegrounds

dont play this game i just got banned for days because of cheating i never cheated even one day in my life and only made two normal easy kills in this round and suddently got banned for days i didnt even get any reasoning for the blockade i seareched online and found out that you get day bans while they investigate the use of unauthorized programs and hardware devices they didnt inform me so i could try to fix it they just banned me with information i was someone that got the game while you still had to pay for it and thats why i will never buy any game of this developer publisher ever again if they just ban people randomly with information,PUBG Battlegrounds
literally unplayable constantly lags wont even load up on boot half the time do not waste your time,PUBG Battlegrounds
it has lots of bugs to logging in to coming back to the lobby in game bugs and theyve been issues for years and the developers wont fix them,PUBG Battlegrounds

do you want a game where frequent stutters and even frequenter cheaters are a thing would you like to drive down a road and randomly flip the moment your car experiences a bump how about a battle royale game that pits you against almost people but then refuses to spawn in any weapons in the first buildings you visit well have i got the game for you featuring pubg battlegrounds the game that used to be called player unknown battlegrounds renamed to be even more redundant join the wonderful world of player unknown battlegrounds battlegrounds thats right not one but two battlegrounds in the name come drive a car that likes to randomly flip over motorcycles that glitch into the ground and act like they have flat tires gliders that defy physics and best of all tons of cheaters with the new cheat detection theyve implemented people can snipe you in the head through thick smoke they see what weapons are in buildings just while driving down the road they can see you through buildings and even have a single button that makes the cheat program take over and headshot opponents in milliseconds so come enjoy your time just dont forget to ask for a refund and yes the game costs nothing now but your time does what is your time worth to you because you might be better off taking that allotted time setting your hair on fire then waiting that amount of allotted time before extinguishing it,PUBG Battlegrounds
i feel like im getting ganged raped by people a once soon as you get good loot or soon as you go in the open,PUBG Battlegrounds
great game but became less fun to play as it got more popular much slower when compared to apex,PUBG Battlegrounds
i bought this back in when it first came out i have as of this writing hours into iti havent played since or so and when i jumped back in i have to go through training scenarios as if ive never played before okay whatever its a minor minute inconvenience however with hours under my belt in this game i cant play ranked and am forced to play in bot lobbies in my second round back after years and after getting my ass handed to me since i got a chicken dinner my second to last kill jumped outside a window firing into the wall and the final kill laid down in front of me and didnt even fire the weapon wow thats good gameplay i dont know whats going on with this game or how they match players but its a slap in the face to give a guy with hours into the game nothing but bot lobbies as if im a year old coming out of cod for the first time frankly its a slap in the face to give any player new or old lobbies with bots this isnt the challenging game they released in where you could easily jump in and play against other people and be challenged to get better its now an overlycomplicated interface meant to get you to spend money on skins and a joke of a game that seems to be riddled with easy bots instead of actual players killing bots isnt fun killing bots isnt satisfying id rather be killed by bad players than get easy bot kills wondering if i killed a bot or a player isnt something im interested in im wildly disappointed in how they seemed to have ruined such a good game i have a lot of good memories from this game but i cant imagine making any more in the future,PUBG Battlegrounds
it was great fun years ago it doesnt appear to be worth jumping back into with the direction it has gone over the years in the devs defense getting live service right inst easy with so much competition it is hard to compete within the prestige market carving out a niche or catering to different demographics may be the only way this game has survived as long as it has in this overinflated market its a shame it appears to have come at the loss of pliability and quality,PUBG Battlegrounds
after a long break i decided to download and play pubg its still trash my system could run it at first person shooter now it barely touches hackers are still a problem so yeah dont install it unless you wanna waste your time and sanity,PUBG Battlegrounds

love the game but have to put a negative review hackers in nearly every single game times out getting instad from the back seat of vehicles driving around and gunning people down like pigs so many players playing with radars or wallhacks its just so obvious when somebody tracks you down and eliminates you before you have a chance to react aimbotting hackers gunning you down with ironsights from meters away people full auto firing sks slr to knock you in th of a second krafton need to wake the fuck up and deal with the hackers,PUBG Battlegrounds

worst game ive ever seen,PUBG Battlegrounds
the cheaters in this game just get worst and worst ever season its getting as bad as warzone the random map selection is always the same map over and over again with the millions that they have made with this game they could get rid of the bugs and the lobby disconnections i recommend this game if you want to lose some friends and make you want to break your screen with your pc but stupid me i keep playing i must be an idiot,PUBG Battlegrounds

pubg anticheat is nonexistent even after years many suspect they sell the exploits themselves and provide unban services dont support this game the devs are corrupt,PUBG Battlegrounds
put crossplay now fix your game,PUBG Battlegrounds
it is impressive that the game plays worse in than when it was released my computer is better now and somehow the game runs worse when the framerate drops from to the game becomes unresponsive and the input lags rendering it impossible to have any control over the camera or your character when you leave a match rarely the game goes back to the menu it is more common that it will just soft lock itself into a nicelooking background image yes it wasnt loading i checked im sorry for the developers working on this i can imagine there are good and competent professionals on the team but somehow even with the the huge pile of money this game was able to make it is still a buggy janky and unpleasant game i had fun playing it back when it was released but the magic worn out and now the lack of quality of this game is more visible than ever the art direction and visuals are fine,PUBG Battlegrounds
dead game,PUBG Battlegrounds
pros good gun play nice different maps cool cons shit optimized looks absolutely horrendous graphicaly mmr is the worst in any game i have ever played feels like i play against pros ever damn game and cant win a single fight nowadays during the peak pubg days i remember the matches where always fair and there was a wide range of skill in each lobby but now its not the same too long i did not read used to be good back when it came out and enjoyed it until ca then everytime i come back to it i leave it disappointed dont play it unless you already are basically a pro feels like all the bad things still are bad and for people who dont have k hours it is impossible to get a a fair lobby or fight back in now,PUBG Battlegrounds
the game was good at the time i played this first year now its a shell of its former self and riddled with hackers i cannot recommend but i appreciate this is one of the original battle royale games,PUBG Battlegrounds

i hate when it takes so loonngg getting into the game,PUBG Battlegrounds
this game is very crash issue,PUBG Battlegrounds
honestly in my years of gaming this has to be the absolute worst game ive played and put hours in to aiming while moving is ass aiming in general is ass the excessive swaying like who tf is swaying a got damn gun that much while standing still cmon bro be honest this game literally has the worst recoil in any existing game i can literally aim better full spraying a vandal on val and an ak on csgo movement is ass and you die with no chances at all other than if you literally camp a building until the next phase you run into the open for second and you die and theres literally nothing you can do you cant even walk over a pallet you will literally get stopped by a tiny little curb healing and or just moving the damage multiplier doesnt make any got damn sense ill literally spray someone will multiple bullets and some one will tap you with a shot to the head and a leg shotwhat about my got damn bullets i put in that dudes chest bro literally damage is a gamble doesnt matter what the hell it is i shoot people in the damn head with an m and sometimes they live wit a got damn lvl helmet and i guess the helmet goes flying off their damn head but theyre still alive then theres me with a damn level helmet getting one tapped with an m its no wonder why they made this game free to play because they dont have enough of a player base to actually load up real games with real players and it takes almost an hour at night just to get a damn ranked game worst of all to play ranked you need to spend money to play ranked when i got back into this game i saw that you had to pay to play ranked in my years ive never had to pay to play ranked and here i am playing these ranked games just to run into the same pro level players over and over again its not even filled with new players every time i kid you not you will get into a game with the same players over and over and over again and its cool that you do but cmon what about the guys who are around my level so im not getting destroyed every corner and actually have skill based matches with a bunch of different people the damn revive takes forever i swear i could do chores and take a shower and even take a walk with my dog before i come back this game is never gonna get to any pinnacle of any point in any gaming history in any alternate universe and reality because of how terrible this game is tgltn has got to have the highest pain tolerance in history because this game is so painful it makes me lose hope in any kind of recovering of what i just wasted all these hours on to just receive more pain over and over again this game has given me the most frustration and im gonna be honest im glad fortnite blasted off over this and brain rotted everybody because the difference between this game and fortnite is that fortnite actually made kidsteenagers and adults happy pubg would have put every human who had to rely on this game into a state that would no longer become recoverable this game if fortnite didnt come out would have cause the damn great depression for a second time and would have made every damn person feel like starting a war sooner than later because of the anger every household would have to deal with and the amount of tears people would drop to the point whered it would make them numb i swear to the lord pubg you better come out with some better movement and atleast add a damn step up feature over a got damn palletwhy the hell is a pallet stopping me from moving in the first place its literally a thin piece of wood you can step over this whole game need a rework or a pubg so they can at least fix this hideous game or leave it behind and start fresh with a whole new canvas i dont create games but it would be more worth it to make a newer better version to create a wider group of players who would truly enjoy it around the world this is a piece of crap that youre trying to mold into a castle but in the end its still a piece of crap thatll slowly crumble unless its fortitude with something truly solid to stabilize its foundation,PUBG Battlegrounds
game so good after minutes in the lobby its starting to lag my whole pc,PUBG Battlegrounds
new anti cheat policy is literally a spywarefor more context read the other comment,PUBG Battlegrounds
chinese hackers,PUBG Battlegrounds
probably the worst first person shooter ive ever played,PUBG Battlegrounds
ai bots in the form of camps and then ai bots people disguised but use the same ai as the camps and so you kinda need to play when its on peak rather than off peak game it self when it came out was really cool and the concept was new but now theyve not adapted to the other markets that other battle royals for me the game as a whole is,PUBG Battlegrounds
full of cheaters end of story,PUBG Battlegrounds
played when it was first out its improved but honestly even with this revival other brs are just better nostalgic to play again but not enough to keep playing,PUBG Battlegrounds
downloaded the game again to try new updates remembered why i uninstalled it uninstalls the game for crashing leaves a negative review,PUBG Battlegrounds
too many bugs and troubles,PUBG Battlegrounds
game is great but hackers absolutely ruin it there is at least per lobby sometimes as many as cant tell you how many times my team has been winning a game got to second place and got mowed down from + yards by a guy shooting exclusively headshots from an lmg or a guy lands headshot after headshot with a sniper every time we peek out this isnt some conspiracy theory either we have gotten multiple players permabanned which does not happen unless they are getting reported by many others and are proven to be hackers sadly they just make a new account return to the game and continue cheating cannot recommend it in its current state,PUBG Battlegrounds
way too many hackers the consequences of making this game fp,PUBG Battlegrounds
devs dont give a shit about this game as long as people pay them their whole dev effort is focused on skins no dlss reflex frame gen to cover for their horrible optimization even though graphics are outdated battlefield v with its nice graphics runs much better on p ultra,PUBG Battlegrounds
first person shooter and input lag = dogshit,PUBG Battlegrounds
the lag alone makes it impossible to play,PUBG Battlegrounds
clunky ass piece of shit,PUBG Battlegrounds
a lot of black screens not a hardware problem but game it self all other games work fine,PUBG Battlegrounds
somehow im still playing with this poopoo the only good thing about this game is that it is super basic but its buggy laggy does not respect players time inconsistent with gameplay rules does not have a map selector still anticonsumer promotes toxic player behavior with different game rules and mechanics the publisher does not care about this game at all only the money if you want to have a happy life skip this game,PUBG Battlegrounds
dead game,PUBG Battlegrounds
just play fortnite,PUBG Battlegrounds
they ruined the game first game back in ages and i got kills without a hassle pures bots literally everyone i came across was a bot and quite literally rubber banding back and forth when shot like a broken robot fun worst shooter ive played in years used to be great,PUBG Battlegrounds
never played it laughing out loud,PUBG Battlegrounds
makes me wanna do what pewdiepie did,PUBG Battlegrounds
i have only played one match and it sucks already the lobbies are half bot half cheaters game play is very slow barely any protection on the map and the graphics are god awful,PUBG Battlegrounds
most of the high ranked players using cheats i know its normal nowadays but dont think the worst one is your dead or elimination from the match you feel better when you catch a cheater and report it the worst one you see will not start until you get an answer the autority the cheater account will just only banned for couple of days maybe a week everyone can have several accounts and that cheater can play from different account for couple of days the answer is very simple thats the worst one,PUBG Battlegrounds
