"i am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. i am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. my son got this game for christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. this was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching youtube. so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you were supposed to do. i asked my son for help and he helped me. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my son since my wife had died. this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. this game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

at this point everything sells for 0.03 due to over saturation, dev has bananas active for more than 24h giving people way too many copies. i personally am just collecting them to inflate my inventory numbers and maybe check back in if game is still going strong in 2 - 3 years when the banana old supply starts to dwindle.

personally, i feel bad for anyone that is buying these especially since they don't do anything it's just a placeholder in account. nobody will respect you for having the bananas the only ones you can really flex with are the ones from on release that have limited stock, especially that cryptic one (25 in existence) and dev holds one of the 25.

it's not a scam, maybe for those that have fomo but for a normal person? you just open game click & get your banana every 3 hours.",Banana

*gameplay*

at its core, ""banana"" involves clicking on a banana displayed on the screen. each click elicits a subtle, satisfying sound effect and a visual cue, rewarding the player with a small burst of confetti or a gentle glow. the game tracks the number of clicks, and as you progress, you unlock different banana skins and backgrounds, adding a layer of customization to your banana-clicking adventures.

the sound design is minimalistic but effective. each click produces a satisfying ""pop"" sound, and the occasional background music is light and cheerful, enhancing the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game.

*replayability*

while ""banana"" might seem like a one-trick pony, its charm lies in its simplicity and the gentle encouragement to keep clicking. the game’s various unlockables provide a sense of progression and motivation to keep playing. however, its replayability might be limited for those looking for more depth and complexity in their gaming experiences.

*pros*

"a banana is an elongated, edible fruit produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus *musa*. in some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called ""plantains,"" distinguishing them from dessert bananas. the fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. the fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant.

### origin and cultivation

bananas are believed to have originated in the region of malaysia, indonesia, the philippines, and new guinea. they were first domesticated in these areas around 7,000 years ago. from there, bananas spread to the pacific islands, africa, and eventually to the americas in the 15th and 16th centuries by explorers and missionaries. today, bananas are cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions across the globe.

banana plants are fast-growing and can reach heights of up to 25 feet. despite their tree-like appearance, banana plants are actually the world's largest herbaceous plants. the ""trunk"" is a pseudostem, a structure made up of tightly packed leaf bases. the fruit develops from the banana heart, a large, purple-red flower that grows at the end of a stem. each banana plant produces a single bunch of bananas, and after fruiting, the pseudostem dies and is replaced by new growth from the plant's underground rhizome.

### varieties

there are hundreds of banana varieties grown worldwide. the cavendish variety is the most common and accounts for about 47% of global banana production. cavendish bananas are the type most commonly found in grocery stores and are known for their creamy texture and sweet flavor. other popular varieties include:

- **red bananas**: smaller and plumper than cavendish bananas, with reddish-purple skin and a sweet, raspberry-like flavor.
- **apple bananas (manzano)**: short and fat, with a flavor reminiscent of apples and strawberries.
- **lady finger bananas**: small, slender, and sweet, often eaten as snacks.
- **blue java bananas**: also known as ""ice cream bananas"" for their sweet, vanilla-like flavor and blue-tinted skin.

plantains are another important group of bananas, used primarily for cooking rather than raw consumption. they are starchy and lower in sugar than dessert bananas, and are a staple in many tropical regions.

### nutritional benefits

bananas are highly nutritious and offer a variety of health benefits. they are an excellent source of potassium, which is crucial for heart health and maintaining normal blood pressure. a medium-sized banana provides about 400-450 mg of potassium, approximately 10% of the daily recommended intake.

bananas are also rich in vitamin c, vitamin b6, and dietary fiber. vitamin c is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage, supports the immune system, and aids in the absorption of iron. vitamin b6 is essential for brain development during pregnancy and infancy and supports immune function. the fiber in bananas aids digestion and can help prevent constipation.

bananas contain several types of antioxidants, including dopamine and catechins, which are associated with reduced risk of heart disease and degenerative illnesses.

### culinary uses

bananas are incredibly versatile in the kitchen. they can be eaten fresh, added to smoothies, used in baking, or even dried and enjoyed as a snack. here are some popular uses:

- **smoothies**: bananas add natural sweetness and creaminess to smoothies. they pair well with berries, spinach, nut butters, and yogurt.
- **baking**: overripe bananas are perfect for baking. they can be used to make banana bread, muffins, pancakes, and cakes. their natural sweetness reduces the need for added sugars.
- **snacks**: fresh bananas make a convenient, portable snack. they can also be sliced and added to cereal, yogurt, or toast.
- **frozen treats**: bananas can be frozen and blended to make a creamy, dairy-free ice cream alternative. they can also be dipped in chocolate and frozen for a sweet treat.
- **savory dishes**: plantains are commonly used in savory dishes. they can be fried to make tostones or chips, mashed to make mofongo, or added to stews and soups.

### industrial uses

beyond their culinary uses, bananas and banana plants have several industrial applications. the leaves are often used as natural plates or wrapping for cooking food, imparting a subtle flavor to dishes. in some cultures, banana leaves are used in ceremonies and traditional events. the fibers from the banana plant can be processed to make textiles, paper, and rope. these fibers are strong, biodegradable, and environmentally friendly.

### economic and environmental impact

bananas are a vital crop for many tropical countries, providing food, income, and employment. they are one of the most important food crops in the world and a staple food for millions of people. in countries like uganda, rwanda, and burundi, bananas account for a significant portion of daily caloric intake.

however, the banana industry faces several challenges. one major issue is the susceptibility of banana plants to diseases. the most notorious is the panama disease, caused by the fungus *fusarium oxysporum*, which attacks the plant's vascular system. this disease devastated the gros michel banana variety in the mid-20th century, leading to its replacement by the cavendish variety. today, a new strain of panama disease threatens cavendish plantations worldwide.

efforts are being made to develop more disease-resistant banana varieties through traditional breeding and genetic engineering. sustainable farming practices, such as crop rotation, intercropping, and organic farming, are also being promoted to reduce the impact of diseases and pests.

### cultural significance

bananas hold cultural significance in many parts of the world. in hinduism, bananas are considered auspicious and are used in religious rituals and offerings. in some cultures, bananas symbolize fertility and prosperity. in the caribbean, bananas are a key ingredient in traditional dishes and celebrations.

### conclusion

in summary, bananas are not just a convenient and nutritious fruit; they are an integral part of many cultures' diets and economies. their versatility in culinary uses, nutritional benefits, and multiple industrial applications make them one of the world's most valuable crops. despite challenges such as diseases and environmental impact, bananas continue to thrive, thanks to ongoing research and sustainable farming practices. the banana is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of one of nature's most beloved fruits.",Banana

"i always wanted to be a fruit seller 🍌, and after playing this game and selling a banana for a whopping $0.03, i’m now richer than elon musk 💸. living the dream, one click at a time! 🚀 thank you to the devs for making me rich :)",Banana
"the banana, a tropical fruit known for its distinctive elongated shape and bright yellow color, holds a place of high regard in the global fruit hierarchy. originating from southeast asia, this fruit has been cultivated for thousands of years and has spread its roots far and wide, now flourishing in numerous countries with warm climates. the banana plant itself is not a tree but a herbaceous plant, making it one of the largest herbs in the world. the ""trunk"" is actually a pseudostem formed by tightly packed leaf bases. bananas grow in clusters, often called ""hands,"" which can weigh anywhere from a few pounds to over a hundred pounds depending on the variety and growing conditions.

the fruit of the banana is wrapped in a thick, peelable skin that protects the soft, sweet interior. this flesh is rich in essential nutrients, including potassium, vitamin b6, vitamin c, and dietary fiber. the high potassium content of bananas makes them particularly beneficial for heart health, helping to regulate blood pressure and maintain proper cardiovascular function. athletes and fitness enthusiasts frequently favor bananas as a natural source of energy and electrolytes, aiding in muscle function and recovery.

bananas come in several varieties, each with unique characteristics. the cavendish banana, the most commonly consumed type worldwide, is known for its sweet flavor and creamy texture. plantains, another variety, are starchy and often used in cooking, especially in african, caribbean, and latin american cuisines. unlike the cavendish, plantains are typically consumed cooked rather than raw, and they can be prepared in numerous ways, including frying, boiling, and baking.

the journey of a banana from plantation to table is an intricate process involving meticulous cultivation, harvesting, and transportation. bananas are usually harvested while still green to allow for transportation without over-ripening. during transit, they are kept in carefully controlled environments to prevent premature ripening. once they reach their destination, the bananas are often treated with ethylene gas to trigger the ripening process, ensuring they reach consumers in perfect condition.

beyond their nutritional benefits and culinary versatility, bananas also play a significant role in various cultural and economic contexts. in many tropical regions, bananas are a staple food and a vital component of local diets. they are celebrated in festivals, featured in traditional dishes, and even hold symbolic meanings in certain cultures. economically, bananas are one of the most important export crops for countries like ecuador, the philippines, and costa rica, contributing significantly to their economies and providing livelihoods for millions of people.

in addition to their direct uses, bananas have numerous byproducts and applications. banana peels can be used as a natural fertilizer, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. the fibers from the banana plant are utilized in the production of textiles, paper, and biodegradable materials. furthermore, ongoing research is exploring the potential medicinal properties of bananas, such as their role in promoting gut health and their potential antioxidant effects.

in conclusion, the banana is far more than just a simple fruit. it is a nutritional powerhouse, a cultural icon, and an economic cornerstone. its journey from the lush plantations of tropical regions to kitchens around the world is a testament to its global significance. whether enjoyed fresh, cooked, or as part of an elaborate dish, the banana continues to captivate and nourish people across the globe, embodying a unique blend of simplicity and versatility.",Banana

"my name is walter hartwell white. i live at 308 negra arroyo lane, albuquerque, new mexico, 87104. this is my confession. if you're watching this tape, i'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law hank schrader. hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. shortly after my 50th birthday, hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. connections that he made through his career with the dea. i was... astounded, i... i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was... thrown, confused, but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. and i was weak. i didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed. every day, i think back at that moment with regret. i quickly realized that i was in way over my head, and hank had a partner, a man named gustavo fring, a businessman. hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when i tried to quit, fring threatened my family. i didn't know where to turn. eventually, hank and fring had a falling out. from what i can gather, hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. fring was able to arrange, uh i guess i guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but hank was seriously injured, and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. upon recovery, hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named hector salamanca, he plotted to kill fring, and did so. in fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. i have often contemplated suicide, but i'm a coward. i wanted to go to the police, but i was frightened. hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. for 3 months he kept them. my wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what i had done, why hank had taken our children. we were scared. i was in hell, i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family. recently, i tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. i can't take this anymore. i live in fear every day that hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. i... all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",Banana

first off, let's talk about the graphics. a banana so perfectly rendered, it could make anyone envious. it's like staring into the soul of a banana that has been carefully crafted to perfection. the yellow hue is so vibrant, you might need to wear sunglasses to avoid being blinded by its brilliance. the gameplay is where the true magic happens. you click. and click. and click some more. every click brings you closer to a number so high, it would make any scientist question their life's work.
the settings button in the corner is a marvel of modern technology. what secrets does it hold? what mysteries lie within? but who needs settings when you're on a mission to click a banana?
in conclusion: very good game. i would recommend it to others. :)

"banana's ascension in the gaming market is not merely a consequence of its addictive gameplay but also a testament to the visionary approach of its developers. the game's premise, centered around the seemingly mundane task of clicking on a banana, unfolds into a rich tapestry of strategic depth and player engagement. this simplicity is the cornerstone of banana's design philosophy, which prioritizes intuitive playability while fostering a complex, player-driven economy. the game's economic model is particularly noteworthy. it extends the boundaries of traditional gaming by incorporating a real-world financial element through the steam marketplace. the banana stickers, which serve as both in-game achievements and tradable assets, have created a microcosm of economic activity that is rare in the gaming world. this innovative feature has not only added a layer of excitement to the gameplay but has also provided players with an opportunity for financial gain, further incentivizing player investment and retention. moreover, banana's commitment to community engagement is evident in its support for player-created content. this approach has cultivated a sense of ownership and investment among the player base, leading to a continuously evolving game environment. the developers' responsiveness to player feedback and their willingness to integrate community contributions have resulted in a game that is shaped by its users, ensuring its relevance and longevity in a rapidly changing market. in the broader context of the gaming industry, banana represents a shift towards games that offer more than just entertainment. it stands as a beacon of player-centric design, where the experiences and inputs of the community are valued and drive the game's development. this philosophy resonates with the modern gamer, who seeks not only to be entertained but also to be heard and to contribute meaningfully to their gaming experiences. in summary, banana is more than a game; it is a cultural phenomenon that has redefined what it means to be a successful clicker game. its blend of simple gameplay, strategic depth, economic innovation, and community involvement has set a new standard for the industry. as banana continues to grow and adapt, it will undoubtedly remain a significant and influential presence in the world of gaming.",Banana

"hi banana dev team,

first off, i'd like to say how much i've been enjoying the game! it's a lot of fun, and the community aspect really adds to the experience. i have a suggestion that could potentially benefit both the game and the players.

consider incorporating ads into the game. by doing so, you could generate additional revenue and return a large portion of that ad revenue to players through in-game bananas. additionally, you could use some of the ad revenue to purchase bananas back from players. this approach would enhance player engagement by providing more opportunities to earn bananas and create a sustainable revenue model for the game.

for instance, players could watch a short ad to receive an extra banana or a chance at a rare item drop. moreover, the revenue generated from these ads could be used to buy bananas from players, adding a new layer of interaction and economy within the game. this way, the game remains free to play, while still offering a rewarding experience for the community.

thanks for considering this suggestion. keep up the great work!

best regards,",Banana

"it would be a stretch to call ”banana” a game, but the description of the product is honest and you’ll know beforehand what you’re getting. the chance to click on a virtual banana to your heart’s content for hours, days, weeks, or months on end. and every so often, you might get a banana that you could theoretically sell, but most often won’t be able to since the supply of virtual bananas by far outpaces the demand.

i don't have any problems with the devs making this program though. if anyone is to blame, it's valve for okaying programs like this. it's a clever idea for making money but it doesn't belong on a platform meant for actual games. i'd rather that steam get plagued with shovelware games than nft-esque programs like this, because at least those shovelware games contain actual game mechanics and a little bit more effort than this.

then, caveman trade skins. developer get 0.01 shiny rock, steam get 0.01 shiny rock, caveman get 0.01 shiny rock. caveman do all work, get almost nothing. developer get 0.01 shiny rock every trade!

game just click on banana picture, not real game.

for example: game give skin every 3 moons. skin worth 0.03 shiny rocks. if caveman get 8 skins in sun, that 0.03 * 8 = 0.24 shiny rocks. minus steam and developer take, 0.08 shiny rocks, caveman have 0.08 shiny rocks left.

many caveman play. now 42,000 caveman. developer make big shiny rocks every sun: 0.08 * 42000 = 3360 shiny rocks!

"banana is technically not the stupidest game on steam because it's barely even a game. there's a picture of a banana that you click on, and that's literally it. that's the entire game.

except not! every three hours or so you get a banana item in your steam inventory, and once every day you get a rare banana item. that's the true reason this game exists: for the developers to make money off steam market item sales, because this game is a meme and people love trading stupid meme items.

none of the bananas actually do anything, mind you, they're useless tokens whose value is determined by artificial rarity. this isn't even the first clicker-market game on steam, but since it's risen in popularity (with the help of bots), there's now half a bajillion copycats trying to make a quick buck with the same idea. after all, one of banana's developers has literally called the game a ""legal infinite money glitch"". valve is okay with all this because they profit from it too, so uh...thanks, guys.

i'll give the developer a [i]little[/i] credit for being inventive with banana types - i admittedly thought the biosnana was kinda cool. it is also, at the absolute least, apparently not a cryptominer or malware. overall though, it's really, really stupid, and an utter waste of time, so don't play it unless you really want to spend 5 minutes collecting one for the meme. you're not gonna strike it rich with e-bananas.",Banana

"so i let this game run in the background for 157 hours and i also bought a few shop bananas for 2,75€. here are the results:

[h3]in short:[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]played:[/b] 157 hours
[*][b]steam drops:[/b] +0,61€
[*][b]shop:[/b] -0,84€

[*][b]profit:[/b] -0,23€
[*][b]developer profit:[/b] 2,02€
[/list]

[h3]steam drops (61)[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]52 common bananas[/b] - (banana, musicanana, moonana, moainana, knight'nana)
[*][b]9 rares[/b] - (retronana, spartanana, stickerbombanana)

[*]every single banana is worth 0,01€ (sold for 0,03€).
[*]each banana has about 264,000 - 1.2 million sellers (who are before you in queue)
[*]total worth: 0,61€
[/list]
so this made 61 cents in one week (157 hours).

[h3]shop bananas (11)[/h3]
[list]
[*]every banana costs 0,25€ in the shop.
[*]at the time of buying, every banana was worth between 0,60€ and 1,85€.
[*]but now, a week later, every banana is worth less than 0,25€, except for the spartanana which is 0,37€.
[*][b]exceptional:[/b] ultranana (no price yet), hacked banana (0,18€), blackholenana (0,09€), biosnana (0,12€), shinobinana (0,10€), disconana (0,11€)
[*][b]ultra rare:[/b] spartanana (0,35€ - but falling)
[/list]

so i spent 2,75€ and if i sell all, i would get 1,16€ plus whatever the ultranana will be worth in a few days. if we just assume it sells back for its initial cost of 0,25€, then in total i still lost 0,84€. 

so if i actually put in the work and micro-sell all these bananas, then 1 week of playing gave me -0,23€. not even including the energy cost of running all day and the deterioration of the pc that comes with it. on the other hand, in the same week (if i sold everything), the developer made through me about 2,02€. 

• so playing a week has lost me -0,23€ while the developer makes about 2,02€.
• not using the shop and selling only drops would make [b]me, the developer and steam[/b] 0,61€ each. ([b]if[/b] you manage to sell them)

[h1]conclusion[/h1]

after a week of intensive playing and investing in ""banana clicker,"" we can draw the following conclusions:
[list]
[*][b]time investment vs. financial return:[/b] despite a substantial time investment of 157 hours, the gaming experience resulted in a financial loss of €0.23. this highlights that the time spent is disproportionate to the monetary outcome.
[*][b]depreciation of in-game items:[/b] the purchased shop bananas suffered a significant loss in value within just one week. this demonstrates the volatility and financial risk associated with trading bananas.
[*][b]profitability for the developer:[/b] while the player incurred a loss, the game generated a profit of €2.02 for the developer. this underscores the disparity between player effort and developer revenue.
[*][b]hidden costs:[/b] the calculation does not account for additional costs such as electricity consumption and pc wear and tear, which would further increase the actual financial loss.
[*][b]game mechanics vs. economic viability:[/b] the game appears designed to motivate players into long-term engagement without offering real financial benefits.
[/list]

in summary, ""banana"" proves to be financially unprofitable for the player. it raises questions about the sustainability and fairness of such game models and emphasizes the need to critically evaluate the value of one's time and resources when engaging with these types of games.",Banana

"the game is just a scam don't play it, originally  i thought people were playing the game ironically since it has 0 ways to upgrade your banana clicking  and you pretty much just watch a number slowly go up  but after a while figured out but pretty much after a while of tediously clicking a banana you get a banana item in your  steam inventory  which might be a rare banana that you can sell on the marketplace for like 10$ but that is very very rare, most of the bananas are actually worth like 3 cents and that will turn into 1 cent since steam taking 5% and devs taking 10% and there is no decimal for cents and since so many people are playing this game and selling bananas on the marketplace you most likely wont get a chance to sell that banana and end  up making 0 cents, the only reason why this game is so popular is the game takes up very little computer resources it is very easily automated and there are small unintelligent children wanting steam credits because their mother didn't buy them any :/ anyway that's my understanding of the game i missed a lot of things just read the other negative reviews they will further prove my point",Banana

"just some crappy clicker ""game"" that children who are too young to even be using steam play in hopes of getting some super rare banana so they can sell it to get ""free steam credits"" when in reality 99.99999999999999999999% of the time you'll get a $0.03 banana in which you will only get $0.01 because whenever you sell an item 1/3 goes to steam, 1/3 goes to the developer of the game, and 1/3 will go to the person selling the item meaning with a $0.03 banana $0.01 will go to steam $0.01 will go to the developer and $0.01 will go to you and with most of the bananas being worth $0.03, a common banana dropping every 3 hours and a rare banana dropping every 18 hours (don't get your hopes up most of the rare bananas are worth only $0.03 too) you will be left with meager earnings while the developer (getting at least $0.01 with every banana sale) with this so called ""game"" getting at most times close to 1 million ""players"" is rolling in all the dough with this unity project they made in 20 minutes. so don't waste your time with this, get a job (if your old enough) and make more money then you will ever will with this game in your lifetime and stop supporting the developer.

"i used to be super active as a steam trader back in the day. here are my thoughts.

it's technically not even a game and sets a bad precedent for games on steam as whole. i will admit that i've made about $0.17 usd in steam wallet funds for interacting with this thing and selling it to folks even more ignorant than me. that doesn't change the fact that there's nothing of value to find here. here's a super simple breakdown of what's going on here.

a player indicates that they've ""engaged"" with the game. the developer then designs a game (under steam's own guidelines) that gives out a marketable steam inventory item to any active player. steam users stick those items on the market and price rises or (more often) falls according to the whims of the speculative market. steam and the game publisher get a cut from each sale and the player gets the rest resulting in the lowest possible sale price for anything $0.03 usd. (i'm not sure how it is in cis countries since i'm american and those countries typically have trade restrictions for plenty... um... [i]geopolitical reasons.[/i])

so what happens? honestly, not a lot. the game's item market gets flooded with literally worthless nonsense and the only folks that really lose anything are those buying .jpg's of bananas for, presumably, real money. in a little while, nearly every item will be  worthless and those listed as having massively inflated prices typically are only there due to the equivalent of a steam art/money laundering or pump-and-dump scam.

as a trader, this is a pretty insignificant blip on the radar and you're better off buying and selling other items. like i said, bananas will rapidly become worthless because the only market for ""valuable"" bananas will be those who already have them. this game isn't a ""scam"" per se but it definitely seems that, if steam allows it, we can see similar ""games"" flooding the store much like how cheaply-made porn has taken over in recent years.",Banana

is this a fucking bitcoin miner or a fucking infinite money glitch!?,Banana
"malware alert! be warned!

so where to start. i'll ignore the dev is a known racist. the game is appealing for one reason, money. you can unlock bananas that can be worth a couple hundred on the market. if you happen to get one of course. most are not worth much at all. so many are playing it for that. but there is a deeper issue here. i think the dev purposely made it this way so he can get it on everyones pcs. 

why? i'm guessing malware. maybe a miner. a/v programs aren't finding anything. so it could be a newly made malware/virus. how do i know this? like a few people, we seem to have issues with banana. when its open, some people experience screen flickering. there have also been issues with the game causing people to not be able to shut down their pc normally. 

me? at first the game ran fun. afterall its just  picture you click on alot. but after awhile i started also have screen flickering.  and after about 20 minutes of clicking, suddenly the mouse cursor kept slowly moving around the screen no matter where i tried to point it. i also heard and endless sound of beeping, like there was some weird error or something. i unplugged my mouse and the cursor stopped of course. but the sounds kept going and i could open anything, everything kept shrinking down to the task bar. i had to use my power button to force a reset. 

i brushed it off as maybe a random bug. and yet, now the game being open still results in screen flickering, and it gets worse as i click. in my task manager, barley any resources are being used, which is a good thing. 

but something is going on that is really fishy. and since many are having the issue, i'd advice people not to download this. it could just be malware in waiting. if you know how this stuff works, it may be triggered at a certain point. how else can anyone explain how a game that has a single picture, can be acting weird? it makes no sense.

and since some posts keep getting removed on the discussions, should clue you in even more somethings wrong. like i said, i've been around a long time now. this would be the best and easiest way to mess with peoples pcs. have a totally free game, where you can click and maybe get something to score tons of cash on steam. to good to be true!

fun fact, if your looking to get a expensive banana drop, guess what? you don't. all the expensive bananas are either listed as no longer available in the drop pool or they are owned by the dev and his friends. after some searching i found some of the devs friends and they also happen to have the bananas. 

so yes, to that end it is a scam for you to but their bananas, and they profit. perfect get rich quick scheme. oh, i've been banned from the discussions from mentioning it.",Banana
"banana is a ""game"" in which you just idle and wait for random drops of bananas of different monetary values to appear in your inventory, it is not a game, there is an element in which you can click the banana but to my knowledge clicking the banana has no effect on anything apart from making the count go up by one. at the time of writing this review this has 839,000 current players, i have heard they are mostly bots just idling the game to sell the bananas on the market in hopes of getting a very rare one. seems like this has spawned a number of clones such as ""cats"", ""cucumber"", ""burger"", ""egg"" , do not recommend just seems like a waste of time if i am honest.",Banana

"[h3]rocketing its way to the second most played game on steam, banana is nothing more than an unironic nft simulator being botted to death for skins. it's a case study in behavioral economics and a warning, should valve sit idle, that the platform will be flooded by more get-rich-quick aspiring players and devs alike.[/h3]

[i]banana[/i] is a lazy unity application with a banana sprite and a number that goes up. is it even a game? not at all; you earn an achievement with your first click, and there is no reward or purpose to continue further. to be clear, it's not the first of its kind [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/egjbdy/recommended/2784840](see its inspiration, egg)[/url] and it won't be the last. at least five exist and more have store pages releasing launching shortly.

""so what? it's harmless,"" you may say... and it's true, it's not directly hurting anyone. it drops crappy skins which can be sold for steam wallet, so users win, valve wins, and the devs win. and to be clear, it is not an nft game - there is no crypto wallet connection or blockchain utilization. besides, the market was built on csgo and tf2's utilization of cosmetic drops.

but here's the thing. it causes ripple effects in ways that aren't immediately visible. if unchecked, it will damage the platform, and hurt developers.

[b]1. it screws up the algorithm[/b] - steam is an incredibly cluttered storefront. asset flips and abandoned early access games outnumber serious releases, which is all the more reason we need help to find good games. enter [i]banana[/i], which isn't even a game, beating out the likes of elden ring, dota 2, gta v, apex. if this represents the 2nd most played game on the platform, it's going to start recommending clickers and idlers to a wide audience that has no interest in them. not to mention it steals spotlight from hidden gems and indies that have no marketing budget, pushed even further down the ladder. less sales result.

[b]2. it sets a dangerous precedent[/b] - meme marketable items have existed for a long time, but this is the first time we've seen sales volumes this high and a game ranking in the top ten. it's making all of the developer community pay attention and signaling, by its existence, that valve tacitly approves of the situation, galvanizing numerous clones racing to emulate this success. will we see a top ten list occupied entirely by jpg printers? it won't be long before the adult / nsfw community attempts it on a wider scale. the race is on, and how far this will go is anybody's guess.

[b]3. it's easily abused[/b] - imagine this scenario: the developer controls the supply of marketable items by setting rarity and drop rates. they could even create an intentionally limited quantity (""only 10 in existence"") to manipulate a high price. now what do you suppose happens if they were to gift themself a few of those limited items? what stops them from listing these on the market to pocket the nearly full proceeds of the sale, bypassing the normal fraction they'd receive from players selling it? steam wallet can be liquidated off platform by spending it to buy other trusted in-demand items, making this a prime opportunity for money laundering.

let me burst a bubble for you right now: you won't get rich off this. with 800k accounts farming bananas, your rare item is probably owned by thousands at the time you obtain it, so don't be surprised by 0.03 sales price and 1 cent profit [i]if[/i] it sells - you have to wait in line behind 40k other people who already listed theirs days ago. the oversupply is only getting worse, and we're seeing developers scramble to come up with creative solutions to keep this ball rolling. expect to see crafting as the next hot topic - mash 500+ skins together for a shot a unique item with its own rarity roll - as an attempt to cut down on the clutter... but will there be buyers for these? or will it be another race to the bottom as sellers undercut one another in the hopes of a payday?

the market is already saturated by this crap and there's no outlet for them. once you buy the item, it sits in your inventory forever unless you write support to delete it or the game adds a delete button or some other way to consume them. the questions that nobody has answers to are, is there a point the market reaches saturation? when will buyers realize 0.03$ skins are worthless investments? how many banana-likes can the community run at once before they or their pcs give out?

the only thing to be said with certainty is, time will tell. i bet valve is nervously hoping it will fizzle out fast so they can dodge another bullet.

"""banana"" on steam is an extremely basic game designed primarily for farming steam items rather than offering any substantial gameplay experience. the entire premise of the game revolves around a static picture of a banana. players click on this image to increment a number displayed above it, and that's the extent of the interaction. this simple mechanic quickly becomes repetitive, and it’s evident that the game exists mainly to exploit steam's item drop system. while it might appeal to those looking to farm items with minimal effort, it lacks any form of engaging content or creativity.

i had hoped ""banana"" would receive a more creative update to enhance its simplistic concept. adding a few mini-games, animations, or even varying levels of interaction could make the experience more enjoyable and justify its presence on the steam platform. as it stands, the game feels like a missed opportunity to turn a quirky idea into something more entertaining and worthwhile. for now, it remains a functional but uninspired clicker designed solely for item farming.",Banana
"i was here for this, but its wrong.",Banana
whoever made this needs to go straight to jail!,Banana
"ya pretty sure most of the people playing this are bots (ironic bots play on steam alot that seems familiar) and this is basically  nfts without the blockchain or whatever, and probably a scam cuz it's likely all the best items go to the devs friends",Banana
what is there to say really. the title is the game.,Banana
"i tryed this game to see if you really can make money and all my banana cost 0.03$ , in 40 hours of autoclick i get just 18 bananas and they cost 0.03$. this game is like you open a case in cs.go and get gold. if you are really lucky you can get something good.",Banana
i bought i ''pandanana'' from the steam market for 0.03€ and it took 14.79€ of my steam balance. scam,Banana
i am violently shitting right now because of this game,Banana

clicker game that seems like a scam but it some kind of nft garbage.,Banana
you're all fucking stupid,Banana
it's just a banana and you click it for a banana that you can only sell for £0.03 i played to see if you would even make much money and i was right it's not worth it and i only got 48 banana's from my play time ,Banana
"how did ""gaming"" get to this point?
it's a banana picture clicker...
useless trash brainrot game 10/10",Banana
"for the first time playing, i spent almost 1 hour to get 10000 clicks manually. i asked myself ""why am i playing this game?"", and can this game be called a ""game""? this game doesn't make me happy because it just clicks my mouse. in this game we can use ""right click"", ""middle click"", and ""left click"" on our mouse, but i only use ""right click"" and ""left click"" because it only uses two fingers (but after almost 1 hour i click my mouse manually, i feel two of my fingers age faster).

i gave this game a ""not recommended"" review because i don't understand the purpose of this game -_-

"a small message to the developers. i understand, the number of people is large, it’s cool.. but you don’t have to abandon the project, development is needed. and there is one very simple thing that needs to be done. you need to create a system for removing bananas from circulation. and this should be done by the people themselves. you can force them by introducing the reforging of bananas. conditionally reduce 20 common ones to 1 of some greater rarity. 40 next, to 1 new rarity. this will allow for further development. without this there will definitely be no future, and the project will soon die. i'll change the review when you enter this. i don’t see any other way for the project, so i really hope and wait",Banana

buy the skins if ur a rerard,Banana
this is the equivalent of sols rng on roblox but a steam game,Banana
"whenever i go afk, i will usually turn this on to farm bananas for pennies (even though they usually wont even sell). however this is not a way to make decent money as the average person will just keep getting common bananas to sell for a couple cents. you may get lucky but the odds are so low that there are so many better ways to spend your time. (in short, you can get it if you want and farm cents for fun, but don't expect to get alot of money clicking bananas).",Banana
you're only enriching the developers.  this is truly a legal money-making scheme ... for them.,Banana
"this game may seem like free funds , but is just a waste of time. you just stay and press, simple enough? no. the probability of you getting a rare banana or even just a banana are very low and also people dont buy as frequent as excepted , and i don't mean that the changes should be very high, or that people should buy every banana they see, but really is just a bad idea for game.",Banana
"it's a game about clicking a png of a banana, nothing special, no skins, no content, no nothing, just a png of a banana, and clicking it gives you more, like most average clicker games, but this one gives you a small chance of an item being dropped when clicking the banana, it has become nft's all over again...",Banana
"i don't think it's a scam in the sense that it is exactly what the dev says. i just think it could, you know, at least be a game even if the main point is to sell bananas at the market. cookie clicker is at least fun (for a clicker game mind you). there's not even a simple click animation or anything. i fail to see any effort in this. 

that said, all the reports around this are pretty entertaining at least.",Banana

there is no inventory system in the game to manage collected items.

3.no use for banana drops:
there is no use for banana drops, making them feel pointless.

4.no menu:
the game lacks a main menu for navigation and settings.

5.no upgrade system:
there is no upgrade system that uses the banana score for enhancements.

6.too simple:
the game is too simple and lacks depth.

7.no sound:
there is no sound, making the game less engaging.

adding potions could make the game more fun and dynamic.

9.no interactive questions:
adding questions or trivia could make the game more interactive.

10.lack of updates:
the game lacks regular updates, leading to a stagnant experience. regular updates with new content, features, and bug fixes would keep the game fresh and maintain player interest.

i believe that if the developer learns from this feedback and adds these features to the game, it will become more popular.

"two of the best reviews for this game i found

the developer of this ""game"" has devised a method to get rich with minimal effort.
thousands of people ""play"" this title in the hope of obtaining rare skins to resell on the steam market. however, in 99.999% of cases, players only get skins worth 0.03 euros.
subsequently, players sell those skins... and this is where the developer's method kicks in!
of the 0.03 euros earned: 0.01 euro goes to the player, 0.01 euro goes to steam, and 0.01 euro goes to the developer!
consequently, in the end, the player earns basically nothing, while the developer earns 0.01 euros for every transaction made!
besides this, in this ""game"" you do absolutely nothing except clicking on the image of a banana.
it’s easy to see that the developer is using thousands of players to make money effortlessly.

practical example:
in the game, a skin is obtained every 3 hours. that skin is worth an average of 0.03 euros.
assuming that each player gets the maximum number of skins in a day, that is 24/3 = 8, and then manages to sell them, by the end of the day each player would earn:
0.03 * 8 = 0.24 euros, minus the commissions for steam (0.08 euros) and for the developer (0.08 euros), wich makes a net profit of 0.08 euros.
however, if we consider the total number of players (currently 42,000), the developer will earn:
0.08 * 42000 = 3360 euros per day!

this strategy is certainly very convenient for him... but it's not right to exploit users in this way.

note: maybe the figures i wrote aren't accurate, but the basic point doesn't change.

it's not a scam per se as a lot of people are saying but it is one of those nft bro attempts at making a return and majority of the people don't realize that only 1% of the ""playerbase"" if you can even call it that would actually make any money and the rest are just wasting their time thinking they found a money making glitch.

as a game it offers absolutely no value and i'm surprised it's allowed on this platform especially with valve being openly against nfts and i expect to see some change as to how the marketplace is going to work in the future especially since bots are flooding so many games now (and people running bots here hoping to get the big money drops).

people will point out that csgo is known for gambling and that it's essentially the same thing but they will forget that for some people those skins are actual collector's items despite how dumb it might seem to a lot of people and the game isn't clicking on a static banana png, it's an actual video game even though the community has gambling issues. don't waste your time or electricity hoping you can sell a png to some chump online and don't abuse systems in place because it will eventually come back and bite the consumer just like steam library share changes due to low regional prices being mishandled by people that don't need those cheaper prices.",Banana

"i rate banana 1/5. bad. extremely boring little clicker/steam inventory economic game which seems similar in conception to most cryptocurrency systems (but in microcosm).

as i was vaguely interested in the economic aspects of this game (and by extension, steam's trading card system), i got it and played it once before finding out it was a russian game. i have since uninstalled it. i made about 2 cents in my steam wallet from playing this game and selling earned inventory items. yay.

gameplay:

you click an image of a banana endlessly (that's the clicker aspect of this game) while hoping steam will award your inventory trading cards which you can then sell (that's the steam inventory economic aspect of this game). 

in a way, economically, it's like a little parody of cryptocurrency schemes: an economy based on nothing but pure faith and speculation and people doing ultimately meaningless work to unlock worthless things which they can then sell to speculators thus temporarily generating money from nothing but otherwise wasted time and effort. nothing is created or produced save unlocked meaningless representations (steam inventory items) of various rarities (the degree of rarity helping to determine their relative monetary values according to speculators who may buy these items in the hope of selling them for higher prices before the market ultimately and inevitably crashes while the game's creators and steam itself make percentages of profit from every transaction which occurs in the meantime. the house always has to have a way of winning somehow, after all, otherwise there's nothing in it for the house to play host to the game/system.). 

since the game is free, playing the game can make you a little tiny bit of money (from selling the steam inventory trading cards) but honestly, if you were to invest a lot of time and effort into this game while following the rules, any actual minimum wage job (and most side-hustles) would pay astronomically better (and earn you far greater social respect and opportunities than playing this game ever will). and let's face it; working at almost any minimum wage job is more fun than playing this awful ""game.""

to play the game you must say that you agree to some fine print which says that you agree not to play the game while using any kind of additional software to cheat at the game (such as automatic clicking software or ai or bots which play the game for you) but i've read online that people are doing this anyway with numerous duplicate steam accounts simultaneously because there is no actual enforcement occurring at any point in this game's economic chain, at least not yet. 

as a little economic experiment, banana had some degree of intellectual interest but the idea that it may ultimately be funneling money (however small that amount may be) to fascist-imperialist russians is utterly revolting and i will not take any further part in banana's little economy. like russia's actual economy, with little to adequately support it beyond speculative bubbles, banana's economy will inevitably crash; it is really only a matter of time.",Banana

"objective interpretation, hardware report, and total game progress

banana is a clicker game. the game was ran on an intel 13900k/nvidia 4090. no system crashes noted and zero crashes to desktop occurred. 3000 clicks were completed at 4k resolution and steam achievement perfection was attained.

1/10 overall score and steam review template is posted below the subjective interpretation

subjective interpretation

well there's not much here as this is some sort of economic clicker game. the premise is you click on a poorly illustrated banana and you eventually get new skins for the banana that you can sell or trade. i was surprised to see that this game supports 4k resolution, but sadly this did not increase the size of the banana. i really wanted a gargantuan banana in my face, but i guess that's too much to ask from the game banana. also, 30 fps cap really? tsk tsk developers. it's free and you can make money off of this game for your steam wallet, but the players time is worth more out in the world if the goal is to acquire capital to buy video games. that's all folks!

"the game is not worth playing due to valve's non-interest in investing into the anti-cheat, low latency servers (128 tick) or just content in general. the devs who work on this product are not quick to output content meaning it is unlikely to be severely improved unlike other games of its ilk which get dedicated content released in a decent cadence. 

the game has cut content from the original cs go with very few of the original game modes available all the while disabling players to play the original game (as it was removed to allow for cs2 to take its place). valve makes more than enough from this game so ideally if you are reading this please actually make something worthy of the collective player base's payments. to new players find a better game worthy of your time, dedication and money. i hope it changes but i doubt it.",Counter Strike 2

there's truly nothing like getting headshot through a wall 100 times a match by a 12 year old who paid £2 for his cheats and will now proceed to ruin 40 minutes of your already precious free time.

valve are a joke, this game is a joke.
the anticheat does absolutely nothing, sub-tick is objectively worse than 128 tick (which valve were too cheap to implement). the ""updates"" this game gets are absolutely shocking, so many game modes are still missing, and instead of improvements to the constant rubber banding, we get more skin cases and tiny adjustments to gameplay (if that).

no surf, no working community servers, no retakes, no decent deathmatch, no working trustfactor, no working anti-cheat, no subtick system that actually works.
there's a reason why every pro tournament is played on 128 tick valve, you cheap money-grabbing layabouts.

valve, you are so lucky to have the playerbase you have for counter-strike, it brings in millions of dollars every week, stop pissing that away with your complete inaction.

i haven't touched this game in months and honestly, very little would get me to return, you're killing the playerbase, and frankly the people who continue to buy these pathetic loot crates are too.

"now cs2 ranks 1st in terms of the number of cheaters. 
valve does not just ban you for using cheats, but also encourages you to play with cheats.
 cheating is not banned even by numerous reports. cs2 is a real paradise for cheaters. 
valve destroyed even what they had in cs go. 
there is nothing at all in the game for which it can be praised.
- no new content for several months
- no new operations (more than 2 years have passed)
- no danger zone
- no team death match
- tons of competitive/wingman/hostage maps missing from csgo
and all this while valve earns hundreds of millions of dollars on cases/keys and at the same time cannot create anything good by suppressing the worst developers in the gaming industry.",Counter Strike 2

cs2's only focus is their competitive audience, but cares so little for the social community-driven servers, groups and networks, that they even killed off cs:go, making it completely inaccessible online even for community servers which supported the best community-designed maps and game modes.

the 'upgrades' cs2 made over cs:go completely destroyed counter-strike's oldest, perhaps greatest community-driven servers and maps known as 'surf'. this isn't even the worst thing they broke regarding community content as the community server browser is now detached from the game itself, and has remained broken, or at least barely functional since the launch of cs2.",Counter Strike 2

"vac (valve anti-cheat) is undoubtedly a remarkable and highly efficient anti-cheat system. its ability to maintain fair gameplay and combat cheating in various popular games is truly commendable. vac has consistently proven itself as a robust and reliable solution that strives to provide a level playing field for all players.

one of the most impressive aspects of vac is its proactive approach to detecting and preventing cheats. with its advanced algorithms and extensive database of known cheat signatures, vac can swiftly identify unauthorized modifications and cheating software. this proactive stance ensures that cheaters are swiftly dealt with, deterring others from attempting to gain an unfair advantage.

moreover, vac is continually updated and improved to keep up with the evolving landscape of cheating techniques. valve, the company behind vac, demonstrates a strong commitment to combating cheating by regularly releasing updates that enhance the system's effectiveness. this dedication to staying one step ahead of cheaters is a testament to the ongoing efforts to maintain fair and enjoyable gaming experiences.

vac's effectiveness can also be attributed to its combination of server-side and client-side detection methods. by employing both approaches, vac can effectively detect and respond to cheats that attempt to manipulate the game's code or exploit vulnerabilities. this comprehensive approach greatly reduces the chances of cheaters slipping through undetected.

furthermore, vac's reputation as a strong deterrent plays a vital role in maintaining fair gameplay. the knowledge that vac is actively monitoring and taking action against cheaters fosters a sense of security and reassurance among the player community. this, in turn, encourages fair play and discourages individuals from attempting to cheat in the first place.

in conclusion, vac is a shining example of an excellent and efficient anti-cheat system. its proactive nature, regular updates, comprehensive detection methods, and strong deterrent effect make it an invaluable tool in preserving the integrity of online gaming. thanks to vac, players can engage in fair and competitive gameplay, ensuring an enjoyable experience for all.

by actively addressing the issue of smurfing, this game has taken a significant step towards creating a more balanced and enjoyable gaming experience. smurfing not only disrupts fair competition but also undermines the efforts of players who genuinely belong to their skill level. the game's commitment to combating smurfing ensures that players can engage in matches that are challenging, yet fair, fostering a healthier and more rewarding gaming environment.

the measures implemented by the game administrators to detect and penalize smurfing are a testament to their dedication to maintaining integrity within the player base. whether through advanced algorithms, player reporting systems, or other means, their efforts demonstrate a genuine concern for the overall fairness of the game. this proactive approach not only deters potential smurfers but also reassures players that their time and efforts are respected and valued.

furthermore, the game's commitment to educating the community about the negative impact of smurfing deserves recognition. by raising awareness and encouraging discussions on the topic, the game administrators actively promote a culture of sportsmanship and fair play. this helps foster a united player community that stands against unfair practices and supports a more inclusive and enjoyable gaming environment for everyone involved.

in conclusion, i applaud the game developers and administrators for their unwavering dedication to not tolerating smurfing. their commitment to fair matchmaking, proactive measures against smurfing, and efforts to educate the community are truly praiseworthy. thanks to their relentless pursuit of fairness, players can engage in matches that are challenging, rewarding, and free from the distortions caused by smurfing.",Counter Strike 2

"game was extremely good during csgo. the ability to run servers at 128 tick felt free and played better than matchmaking. valve, in their infinite wisdom decided to create subtick but cap it to 64 so that the game produces a significantly worse rubber banding experience than 100ms servers even with low ping. i have more than 1000 hours in this game (produced mainly while playing csgo) and have around 200ish at most hours of playing cs2. this change is absolutely trash, he grenades blind you if someone peaks after it explodes since they can see through the dust cloud but you can't, the graphics are cranked up to 10 so you can't focus on things that are truly important because for some reason they're trying to make this a aaa game, gun fights/spraying feel terrible due to subtick being trash, peaker's delight (if you're terrible and just like to run and gun you will most likely be rewarded), and the anti-cheat doesn't do its job half of the time making wall hackers rampant. additionally, i cannot get over the fact that a plethora of lvl 0 or 1 accounts with 60 hours are pumping me like i am on orange youtube and competitive is now a joke. i can't do it anymore, as a community we need to start saying no to companies that keep making changes that aren't welcomed or wanted this entire thing is now a joke and i'd rather spend my time elsewhere. you win valve, i don't want to play my favorite game anymore.",Counter Strike 2

"
well now, cooper, lemme tell ya 'bout this here counter-strike 2. boy, i ain't been this disappointed since my hound dog ran off with the neighbor's cat. this game ain't nothin' like the good ol' days, i tell ya what.

first off, the graphics. they mighta polished 'em up a bit, but it don't hold a candle to the charm of them old, blocky textures we had back in the day. it’s like slappin' lipstick on a pig – it still ain't no beauty queen.

and the gameplay? lord have mercy. back in my day, we had ourselves a real shootin' match, none of this fancy-schmancy runnin' around like a chicken with its head cut off. the guns don't feel right, cooper. the recoil’s got more bounce than a bullfrog in a bucket, and the hitboxes? don’t get me started – they're jankier than a busted-up pickup on a dirt road.

then there's the maps. they took classics like dust2 and turned 'em into a dang maze. i got lost quicker than a tumbleweed in a windstorm. they ain't got no respect for the old ways, just messin' with perfection for the sake of it.

and don’t even mention the community. used to be, you'd find folks who knew how to play a proper game. now, it's filled with more squeakers and cheaters than a county fair pie-eatin' contest. ain't no fun when half the folks you're playin' with are glitchin' and hackin'.

shoot, cooper, if i wanted to deal with this much frustration, i'd just try to teach a pig to sing. counter-strike 2? it ain't worth the powder to blow it to hell. i give it a miserable 1 outta 10 star-rated boners. ain't nothin' but a heap of broken promises and shattered dreams.

if you’re lookin’ for some real shootin’ fun, you best stick to the classics. this here newfangled version ain't fit for nothin' but linein' the bottom of a birdcage. hell no, cooper, save yer money and git yerself somethin' worthwhile.

"[h2] brutal & annoying[/h2]
i think everyone should give [b] elden ring[/b] a chance and although i have an antipathy to soulslike games i tried it only because of the hype. do i regret it? not at all, but there were a lot of things that bothered me. 

first of all, i have to say that we are getting a complete, comprehensive game at a fair price. it was designed from the beginning so that nothing was cut out, like in other games. the game world is incredibly varied and the bosses are ruthless and the possibilities are endless.

my main problem with the game is not the difficulty, but the movements and the battle camera.
the character's movement is too clunky and all these forward rolls, backward rolls, sideways rolls that you do are too slow. there should be a way to dodge attacks faster and further. my little 8-year-old brother can do forward rolls faster than the character in the game. 

this camera control is giving me eye cancer. sometimes you can't see anything at all when you're aiming at the enemy and trying to avoid their attacks, because you almost get an epileptical attack from all the explosions and lightning and everything else.

then there is the story, which is told in an extremely cryptic way. i understand almost nothing. i have watched hours of youtube videos about the lore and everything else and i still don't understand it. maybe there isn't much to understand. i just have to accept it.

i find it extremely annoying that so little is explained. i have to read through the wiki so often to understand how something works. and why doesn't the game tell me that when i die and my 150,000 runes, which i have collected with such effort, are dropped at the place where i died and then when i die again they are gone forever. a small info display for that would have been nice.

then a few little things that annoy me. there is no ultrawide support and there is a 60 fps limit. the game uses easyanticheat, so you would have to turn it off and mod the game to be able to play with ultrawide and more fps.

"they shouldn't have nerfed it because it was to hard. thats the whole point of the game. it's a souls like, the best souls like if you will. it has a awesome looking open world and on top of that the story and or lore is amazing. i beat the dlc pre nerf and wouldn't want to be any easier. i'm a better player and also the excietment of beating those bosses were the best. 10 out of 10 would recommend",Elden Ring
this game is truly generational. you can tell the devs poured their heart and soul into everything in this game. a truly unique open world rpg experience. if you are new to the franchise please do yourself a favor and play this masterpiece. dont forget the dlc as well. this game is truly sensational 10/10.,Elden Ring

i am not good at this game. 10 out of 10,Elden Ring
"i've been waiting to write a review for so long because being a fromsoft fan i knew the dlc would be elden ring at it's best. 

i wasn't wrong with that assumption.

however, the dlc (in my opinion) needs to be bought with the base game. there are reveals and things that happen in the dlc that make the rest of the game a far more cohesive and enjoyable [in my opinion] experience. 

the story feels complete with the dlc.

that being said, i love this game. it has it's weird or questionable moments, but other than that, i truly believe it's a masterpiece everyone who's even the slightest bit interested should try for themselves.",Elden Ring
"i have never written a review for any games, so you can imagine how much this game and it's dlc have impressed me. the base game is amazing, the map is huge and you can spend hours upon hours exploring it to your hearts content, and find valuable and outright op weapons that you can abuse. i looked up a guide for the golden seeds and sacred tears, because i just wanted to max out my flasks, and finish the game dark souls style, where i just focus on the combat and fight the bosses. the game is designed for you to take advantage of the items you have at your disposal. the phrase ""git gud"" gets thrown a lot, especially after the dlc, but i believe if you truly play the game on your own and don't copy a build off the internet, you are good. people have been review bombing the dlc for it being too hard, which i believe is not fair. the dlc's in the souls series have always been harder than the base game, but elden ring has accumulated a way larger fan base than dark souls and a lot of attention brought a lot of broken builds that trivialized the game for a lot of players, so these players that looked up different builds for their character are having trouble with the dlc, because there aren't a lot of broken builds in the dlc, because it's still fresh out the oven. if you plan to look up builds or what items to use to cheese the game, please don't waste your time and just watch a stream, because you won't get any satisfaction from the game. if you plan to play the game on your own, you will love every second of this game, even if your build is op, it is your build, even if you use summons, magic, spirit ashes which are commonly frowned upon in the community, it is still your character in an rpg game that you have spent hours optimizing. i watched a streamer beat prime radhan (the final boss of the dlc) with a weapon that dealt way much more damage than mine and another that cheesed it with a greatshield (it's only cheesing if your chat builds you character for you), but i couldn't bring myself to throw away my trusty claymore with which i have finished every souls game to have a better chance at beating the boss. this stubborness finally paid off after hours upon hours of fighting prime radhan with my claymore, because i could really say i beat him, not another streamer or player that found an optimized build to trivialize the game.",Elden Ring
game is alright i guess,Elden Ring

"visual and gameplay masterpiece with obscure but compelling storyline. it heralds a new age of gaming for open world genre. if you are new to souls-like series, this is the best game for you.",Elden Ring
"i think the base game is fun, challenging enough that makes me want to go back to each boss. i do think the dlc is not as good as i had hoped. all enemies do so much damage, and the bosses kill you with max health in only thee hits. all bosses have persistent attacks that give off very few opportunities to do much.",Elden Ring
"i mean, like yes, it's one of the best games ever made. you just have to be prepared for a heart attack in your 30s with no previous symptoms. i almost quit the base game over fire giant and i almost quit the dlc over the final boss. i guess i like pain and punishment and sadness and stratospheric levels of stress and pain again. although i really don't. i just couldn't stop playing it. so thanks from software and miyazaki-san for making me even more confused about what i want out of life. oh yeh, for anyone with younger brothers who play games together. remember when you were kids and you used to button mash on any tekken game and just wait for your brother to go nuts and throw his controller at you? yeh, that's exactly what miyazaki is doing to us with the dlc final boss. i knew my brother would get his revenge one day, i just didn't think he'd be so cruel about it.",Elden Ring

"i am absolutely blown away by this game. i originally bought it when it came out, didn't get very far and didn't think it was for me. revisited it with all the dlc hype and i was totally wrong. this game is consuming all my free time. it's one of the most engaging games i've played in so long that feels so rewarding to overcome all the challenges. true character progression and learning more about the game, it's lore, and the lands between has been incredible and i'm so happy i gave it a second chance.",Elden Ring

"fromsoft makes my favorite games, and i always look forward to each of their releases. elden ring is the most approachable fromsoft game, and it is absolutely fantastic. they went so hard and it shows.

side note, i do think it's a bit silly that it garnered a community that constantly argues over what the right way to kill a boss is",Elden Ring
very fun and relaxing game. the kids will love it!,Elden Ring
"this game is simply amazing, i've played dark souls 3, sekiro and bloodborne prior to this, but my god this tops it all of, even my girlfriend who does not like this kind of games started to play elden ring.

"base game is fantastic. played most of the soulsborne games minus sekiro. the dlc alone is massive, it almost feels like a second game. hoping we get performance updates and patches soon cause the fps drop during some of the fights and the npc aggro tracking for sure needs work. other than that its a great game and  i reccomend it to all beginner soulsborne players.",Elden Ring
"if your game has 59 hours average playtime in length, you've peaked as a game dev. 
20/10 this shit is awesome",Elden Ring
"a good game ruined by its open world and recycled bosses. if they just scrapped the open world this could have been the best souls game out, but it only lead too a mass amount of recycled bosses and empty areas. dungeons arent fun when its the 20th one and it looks the same. however apart from that the bosses are fun too fight and the mix of weapons are great.

"this game is truly a one of a kind experience. a kin to the first time in open water or flying in an airplane. it can't well be described. it's not as hard as the darksouls games and gives you unparalleled freedom. it is a great challenge none the less. you will see things far more creative than your own wildest dreams. magnificent in design. a true masterpiece if i do say so myself. 
i recomend the game for anyone who has patience, nothing excessive. (give or take a boss or 2...3 haha). if you have a hunger for adventure and exploration this game is a thanksgiving dinner made by granny herself. 
at whatever price point the game is being sold at...it is worth every penny. if you see it on sale....mug someone idk. go into debt. it's just so good i can't believe it's not butter. 

p.s. most enjoyable with an xbox controller imo. 

tldr: game is one of a kind, hard buy!",Elden Ring
greatest game i have ever played. bar none.,Elden Ring
"the game's simply wonderful, with the base game providing a lot of fun and challenge for newcomers, and the dlc providing a hefty difficulty spike for those who think they know it all. if you like the souls series, definitely check the base game out, and consider the dlc- it's certainly not for everyone, but it's one hell of a time.",Elden Ring

"another classic from fromsoft. one of the best souls games made, and would highly recommend for anyone into the souls series, or anyone who is a fan of rpgs. i will say that there is one minor drawback of re-play-ability as a lot of the side bosses are often recycled. however, the lack of re-play-ability is made up for by the entire game being jam packed with content.",Elden Ring

definitely the best game i have  ever played...",Elden Ring
"first of the dlc is absolutely beautiful! i´ve slayen most of the bosses by now and everyone of them was memoriable with cool designe and music. the only issue the dlc have is the miserable performance, but this is something they will fix eventually.

what i dont understand is the hate this dlc gets, the pepole are whinning over the difficulty of the bosses and instead of getting good or using the op mimic tear they´re constandly complaining that the bosses were to aggressive and there combos to long. i dont get it, the fromsoftware games are famouse for there difficulty, the whole souls-like subgenre is based upon these games. everybody who plays these games should understand that there game journey is full of frustration and dying over and over especially the new players who played no souls-like or fromsoftware game before.",Elden Ring
"absolute peak of a dlc, my literally only problem is the abyssal woods area felt underutilized for its large size and also no use of torrent. and the scadutree's getting buffed in this patch but other than that def gonna run through this game a few more times.",Elden Ring

beat the lving shit out of my son. 10/10 would recommend,Elden Ring
i've enjoyed the game a little bit,Elden Ring

great role playing game where you role play as the victim,Elden Ring
i already beat this game this is my alt haha,Elden Ring
"open world dark souls, with some influence from sekiro and bloodborne thrown in.  it's all gravy.

the dlc is even better, and is approximately at least 70 percent of the main games landmass, with about as much content. so it's more of a sequel than just an expansion but erdtree and the main game is worth the asking price or a sale. 

runs great on my pc, and i have a fairly modest set up, a amd 5600x and an rtx4060. if i turn on raytracing to maximum i get some dips but it's definitely playable like the console version while looking a touch better, without raytracing i get a locked 60fps on max settings.",Elden Ring
"i actually started playing elden ring on the ps4 back when i first came out, but sinds last year i have been playing it on steam too, might as well leave a review.

this game kinda saved my life back in 2022, i was in a dark place and needed help. (cheers for mental health crisis)
without going to much in detail, i was on a waaaayy to long waiting list for help and i just needed to wait it out, in the hope i didn't do the big self-deleting in the meantime.

i took a gamble and started to playing elden ring, in the hope this would keep me busy, i love open world games, but i wasnt the biggest souls fan. i fell in love with the game sooo fucking hard that i manged to keep me sane, while the game driving me insane sometimes, but hey that is what makes this game so great.
exploring all there is, and that fucking dopamina hit when the screen showed ""god slain"" after the big end boss. it was what kept me going, and comming back!

2 years later i am in a much beter place and getting my live back together, still madly in love with this game, enjoying the dlc and have a half sleeve tattoo of maliketh (best boss)

in short, this game helped me immensely to stay sane during a crisis.

100/10 would ""try fingers, but whole"" again

its a souls game that should say it all,Elden Ring
this game is a masterpiece,Elden Ring
"the base game is great, been playing it since it came out. the visuals are incredible and the boss fights are even better. i was very excited to play the new dlc when it came out and it sure didn't disappoint! it's a lot harder and makes you think and strategize with your builds and things. it's everything i always wanted it to be!

"dlc made it better.
i was going to wait until after i completed the dlc to give it a proper full review but i feel like this needs to be done now to counteract the stupidity of some of the playerbase that isn't happy about how you need to actually play the game to play the game.
it's good, stop whining about not wanting to get better at a game based around its difficulty and sense of achievement from getting better at the game.",Elden Ring

"**received for free = won in a giveaway**  this is in no way, shape, or form a requested review.  in the words of mark from rdc world : i'm unsponsored, so i can say whatever i want.

hadn't seriously played a souls title since dark souls 1 at launch.  didn't tolerate 2 or 3, and absolutely hated the fact that the industry tried to constantly replicate and copy the same game type only to leave many jaded.  (i wanted to love code vein... really did, but no)

that being said, going into elden ring 2 years after it's release was good for me.  it's souls, so expect to get hit 2-3 times and either die or be close to death.  each area cleared feels like a mini triumph, with most bosses being infuriatingly thrilling... true to fromsoft's style.  enemies are constant level, skill, and gear checks.

but past the fact that 98% of this game world is constantly trying to stun lock and kill you, the environments are gorgeous.  from the expansive views to the muggy feeling of walking through a catacomb and seeing blood pools everywhere.

it was truthfully a gift to have played dark souls and still retain enough knowledge to take the silly messages in stride, and to muscle through the constant deaths in areas where my build just isn't suitable.  only thing i'm not liking at this particular point is the fact that greatswords seem to be the way to go most, if not all the time.  when your dagger, longsword, katana, whip or whatever you may have doesn't stagger certain enemies, greatswords seem to push right on through and get that stagger or knockback you'd want in your normal weaponry.

otherwise, this ain't for the weak, easily discouraged, or overly stubborn in the wrong places.  peep, prepare, position, and poke.",Elden Ring
"posting this cos the dlc came out. fun game, good exploration, large map with lots of weapons and bosses and you can co-op or fight other players.",Elden Ring

"never played a souls game.  my computer can barely run this (pentium processor), and i die so many times.  still one of the best games ive ever played.  never had a game make me feel genuinely triumphant after overcoming a challenge like this one does.  10/10",Elden Ring
"one of my favorite games of all time, i got the platinum trophy on playstation and just got all the achievements on steam before i play the dlc. i highly recommend if you enjoy souls games, if you've never played a souls game watch some videos before you try it out because it can be difficult at times.",Elden Ring
"outstanding expansion, the map is beautiful, the weapons and armor are amazing, and the npc questlines feel more natural and rewarding than the base game
the bosses are definitely harder, and force you to adapt your playstyle, but are doable if you explore and have enough blessings",Elden Ring

"probs the best game of the decade, i do still prefer ds 3",Elden Ring
"finished the dlc, and besides the questionable final boss, i don't quite share the sentiment of the people who find the game to be ""too difficult"" now. it's an open-world game and if any of us actually learned a lesson from margit from the first game, bashing your head against the wall doesn't work and you get incentivized for actually exploring the rest of the extensive world and actual map created for the dlc.

i do feel like bosses like gaius, messmer, and i cannot stress this enough, the final boss, do have some questionable movesets or design in them that are very frustrating, but i feel like it doesn't warrant the amount of hate the game is getting just because they refuse to play the game with the mechanics that are freely available to you if you wish to. 

you control the buttons you press",Elden Ring

this game is endlessly replayable, amd the more you play, the more you can objectively improve. the way you interact with this world actually feels like you are, and not just some nerd clicking a mouse and keyboard and hundreds of apm in an arpg or something.

elden ring is a masterpiece ! buy rent do whatever you do to play if you like this kind of game :) which is like a rollercoster of feelings because you die so many times to one boss you begin hate the boss and after some time you respect them and the fight became a dance between lovers in the end and when you finally win you feel like you are on the top of the world !,Elden Ring

character design - 10/10
boss fights - 10/10

i'll be the first to admit when i picked it up it felt too large to dive in, the fear of missing things grounded my playthrough into the ground. picking it up, years later, i can see where i went wrong and couldn't put it down. after an 80+ hour playthrough, killing every single boss in the base game and now moving onto a great dlc (just after killing messmer), i haven't been able to put it down. highly recommend to any players wanting more challenging gameplay, who is willing to put in the effort to improve and to find out more about this huge open world. worth every penny.",Elden Ring

"elden ring was a first from's game that i played. i was shocked of how ""difficult"" it was and i relied heavily on heavy armor and heavy weapons, pun intended. after around 200+ hours playing it (actually i clocked to 500+ hours when considering that i was playing offline before i bought it via steam) i realized this game is actually a masterpiece because it's very technical. it has unique pattern where you ""hit but don't be greedy - dodge/block/parry - repeat"" everytime you're facing difficult enemies or bosses. you can also use the environment to help you. when you put your mind into this game, it's actually very rewarding. i can parry and riposte almost all of the enemies and bosses in the game, even in the dlc, sometimes it feels i'm cheating death (or more of like calculated gambling). if you're just casually playing it, you probably won't enjoy elden ring series (and the dlc). i personally love quality time (my love language, surprise surprise!), so i just explored and enjoyed all of the content within the game, not rushing it to finish the game asap. it feels like heaven, one of the best experience i am having. i remember this feeling back then when i first playing gta san andreas. you can't forget incredible feeling of video game experience like that. thank you from software for this another masterpiece!",Elden Ring

"it was about 50 hours of content for me. well worth the price.

it's very hard, but it feels nice. they use an alternate leveling system which is actually pretty cool since it sort of puts everyone on similar levels much easier.

if i was to offer any real complaint, there's a really good reason to do npc quest this time around, as it thematically leads to an important moment; arguably the best story telling fromsoft has ever done. but it's also really easy to miss all of them. even trying to do them i missed a few of them. there's no shot without a guide i would have done some of the steps. one of which was a huge ""what?"" since after doing the same thing three times with nothing happening, i would have bailed... but you need to do it a total of 6 times for it to properly resolve. whoever discovered something like that was insane.

for real though, that doesn't really tarnish the enjoyment i got out of the game. even if you don't want to use a guide and you don't get that great moment; this is a souls game at its finest.",Elden Ring

"the best dlc ever made, it should be called a old school expansion. 

i can talk about why it is so good and things i think could make the dlc better, but, i am making this comment to share a fix. copy paste from my reddit comment:

i have a confirmed fix for the performance issues i and my 2 friends had. i have not seen this fix on steam nor reddit so far.
first of all, i install new drivers manually, and i had no stutter or small freezes, which two of my friends had. 

i got curious and installed the new nvidia driver that mentions the dlc specifically and was hoping that it might help me with the consistent 5 lower fps(not stuttering) in very few areas i get. and low and behold, i started getting stutters. after i rolled back to the previous drivers it fixed the issue.

"buyer beware!

the problem with fromsoft souls games is that hidetaka miyazaki and most of his diehard fan base, ignorantly equate frustration and troll mechanics with ""game difficulty"".. the entire genre is based on getting smacked around by some mob that is tuned like some bully that beats up on ignorant unsuspecting children until they go through enough humiliation and frustration to figure out the attack patterns of said bully. it's pretty much the same model as the original dragon's lair game, but obviously with a much more modern format, and with behind your back spawns, unavoidable jump scare attacks that are often a one shot/stun lock till you're dead, and mobs who's dodges and attacks are keyed to your inputs. all so that you know what not to do next time, and achieve a sense of haggard accomplishment as you take 3 steps forward, and 2 steps backwards all the way through the game... 
again, it's not difficult at all despite what some confused people like to brag about. it's just a frustrating slog until you figure out the patterns, then it becomes simple and boring. miyazaki is right to say he can't make it less ""difficult"", because if you lower the difficulty it would be apparent that this is all there is to the game. it's perceived ""difficulty"" is it's selling point. i'm not saying the game doesn't require skill, because it definitely does. but the skill it requires is simply muscle memory, and a whole lot of patience. it has to train you to beat the game, bit by bit through it's one track mechanics. once you figure out the pattern/meta, or you level up enough to just button mash your way though the boss, it's ugly underbelly is exposed and you're left with a sense of.. 'why did i buy this again, what was i expecting? it certainly wasn't to be trolled by this video games mechanics.. '
there's no intuition required as in other games. the meta in this game for many is to hope and pray for a lucky break where the proverbial wall you're beating your head against becomes soft where it wasn't the last 50 times you tried it. it's probably one of the most lame and boring formats in all of gaming history imo. 
 here's to hoping that the future will bring us game developers that can actually craft a great game! i'm not holding my breath though.. rdr2 is the current apex of gaming, and as great as it is, even that game(and company), have issues with development.",Elden Ring

"review for dlc only: a disappointment.

not because of the common reasons i've read in negative reviews of bad designed bosses or technical issues, but because i've come to realize that this dlc is all about the things in souls games i de-value vs all the things in souls games i highly value.

for reference, at this point in the game i've beaten blackgoal knight, a few ghostflame dragons, death rite bird, ancient dragon man, dancing lion, rellana and a few other minor/major bosses and unlocked about 65% of the map.

for example, in the early souls games (demon's souls, dark souls) - i thoroughly enjoyed close quarters combat , exploring castles, ruins, nooks, crannies. having to work your way through a themed area/level while fighting mobs to joyfully reach a bonfire and then continue onward to the next bonfire and eventually your reward of a final boss fight. think of all the epic ""locations"" and ""cities"" in the souls games. those are great to me. an example in this game is castle ensis. when i got there i was excited as it harkened back to the start of dark souls/demon souls with a castle and i eagerly dove in. i was shocked after just a few minutes of pushing through mobs i was at the boss door. 

also great to me is my character's progression. the finding of new weapons, items, spells and the constant struggle to gain some foothold in the world as i level up. getting 1 pt in a certain attribute to get to that breakpoint where it allowed me to equip something felt great. 

in the dlc, both things above feel extremely minimalized. riding around in your horse is paramount. the space is vast. having to work through mobs to get through a 'level' isn't really there compared to the other soul's series. sure, there are parts, but just some parts. you can ride into a town and just blow through it if you choose. world bosses are a neat idea but just copy / pasted dragons and huge fire ball throwing guys are just that...copy/pasted. same with the 'dungeons' you find that are copy/pastes. 

character progression also feels trivialized. there's nothing to aspire to when it comes to that next epic stat breakpoint or a weapon/gear you need to equip to make your build work. you are +10 in every item and stats are just to the point of 'getting more is better'. the goal instead is to collect scadutree fragments. 

bosses need to be over tuned to compensate and everything in the game feels more like an arms race with maxed out stats across the board for everything and everyone , including you. there's no nuance. no decisions on advantages/disadvantages. every boss has every thing (fast, strong, defense, offense, aoe, etc). and most people by this point in the dlc also can have high str and dex and int and fai and arc .....so no spell or ashe of war or summons or most anything feels like an interesting or significant upgrade to be excited about.to me that is evident in the lazy design of the scadutree fragments - just collect these and you get overall buffed up. really? that's lame and really uninteresting and hard for me to even see/feel/quantify when i'm playing so it really diminishes the joy of levelling. oh boy, a fragment , i'm 10% stronger and more durable now. look i can tell because that hit took only 137 damage off me not 141. :(

the dlc is clearly designed as content for people who enjoy 'git gud' and the dlc aims to come at the player hard in boss fights. that's cool. i've beaten every souls game from fromsoft and every other souls game from other developers and enjoy the genre a lot. however this game feels beautiful but empty - both literally in it's world riding around with little to no secrets or any interesting pois or mobs i need to work through and it's overall boring world design of just lots of cliffs to it's empty feeling of copy / paste bosses and lackluster 'zones' that i do need to work through (like the zone for the fissure depths - laser beam rocks and just boring boring boring), in addition to it's overall lack of character depth and progression to the point of simply collecting rocks to 'git better'.

sadly the true disappointment is after enjoying the struggle in elden ring base game and other fromsoft titles in the souls genre, i simply don't enjoy the different type of struggle in this game - which is the struggle to stay interested. 

i probably would have felt less disappointment if i bought this on a 50%+ discount. so that's my recco for those wondering if worth the investment if on a budget. if you enjoy the open world, horse combat , world bosses and extreme boss fights, and just all around are a fan of every aspect of elden ring and want more of it - it's worth full price. if you liked elden ring but harken back to demonsouls/darksouls as your favorites in the fromsoft universe and enjoy the journey of developing your character, the feel of early elden ring and other souls games more - it's a discount purchase only , or not at all.

in conclusion, the dlc is not bad (mostly). there is a lot offered, it's a challenge, it can be beautiful and it continues the elden ring adventure. it does have a distinct approach that definitely funnels more towards horse/open world/arms racing than progression as a design choice (which is fine). where it is somewhat objectively bad is in the lazy scadutree/revered ashe fragments to make you 'git gud' as a global band-aid and some of the technical issues foks are having with framerate. where it left me wanting is in connecting me back to what i personally enjoyed most in previous fromsoft titles which is interesting level design, themed progression based areas and an excitement in advancing my character in different and meaningful ways to meet challenges.",Elden Ring

"stop complaining about the difficulty of the game. the problem with the game isn't that it's difficult, it's that the combat design is crap.
 v rising brutal mode is a difficult game, i spent 6 hours fighting adam. on malenia i spent 3 hours without a single cheeze. and malenia's combat design is rubbish, while adam's combat design is fucking awesome.
malenia's waterfall is impossible to figure out where to hit box damage, in phase 2 another attack like that is added, the whole difficulty of which is that you can't see where or how the damage will be dealt. the boss just jumps on your screen throwing various hit box damage, to which you have only one answer - the dodge button. of course you can throw a freeze bomb at it, you can summon a mimic, friend, brother, letmysoloher and so on. but none of that cancels out the bad design. 
in v rising i didn't need any guides or help from friends, just honest reactions and knowledge of mechanics that the game doesn't hide from you.",Elden Ring
"[u]base game[/u]: outdated and obtuse but serviceable combat within a very detailed and pretty hellscape. decent game for everyone that i would recommend.
[u]dlc[/u]: unreasonable combat that clashes with its already outdated mechanics, but it's an even prettier hell of a world. the dlc is not something i'd recommend to most people.

i liken the elden ring experience to eating a spicy dish. fromsoftware's games have always been a bit obtuse, and just like spicy food it's not really for everyone. so it's a bit of delight when they get so much recognition. they make good curry.

the base elden ring game is a bit of a foray into newness for them because they haven't ever made a world this big yet, and that comes with advantages and disadvantages. for one, the world it's set in is gorgeous and fun to really just traverse in; that however means there's a whole bunch of empty space not occupied by corridors and enemies. it also extends the amount of time for a single run for the average player, which depending on who you are is a good or a bad thing. overall i think the game has really good presentation thanks to its visual language, its visages, the music that flows between ambient and bombastic when needed, and just the strange and mysterious elements that fascinate a lot of their audience.

the dlc is all of these things and more, and that's not necessarily a good thing; just like how it's not always a good thing to make a dish spicier. the expansion adds a whole new map that's a bit more compact, but it shares a lot of the same characteristics of the base game. it's really pretty and i like how a lot of enemies and architecture that just juxtapose itself with that of the base game. the story that unfolds uncovers a few of the things that never really got an explanation at all, and you meet characters are much more likeable albeit their brief appearances.

what's absolutely unacceptable is their decision to make combat so unbalanced and nonsensical. the base game occasionally has issues where enemies would just spin on the spot and hit you, and that unintuitive and silly implementation is everywhere in the expansion. they also have been entertaining this obtuse way of breaking people's reflexive response by delaying attacks in awkward ways, and it's excruciating egregious in the dlc. on top of that, they decided tough enemies should just attack endlessly without any good indicators of when their attacks end. they basically broke every rule of a real time combat game and instead of making them some pioneer into the genre, it makes elden ring's combat unreasonable. the dlc exacerbates this problem instead of solving it, and that alone makes me incapable of recommending this to anyone despite how much i love the rest of the game.

i think fromsoft cooked a bit too hard this time around.

"played this game for 5 hours to get a single item to upgrade one item once, to which no noticeable difference is made and not for one second did i even have fun on the arduous journey, just continuous bosses who are designed to defy the games own concept of combat, if you want fun its not this game if you want to spend hours of your life having a headache and having thoughts/actions of damaging your own property, this is for you.
and after playing this game for 260 hours, i can say the only concept of ""joy"" you may get from this game is beating a boss who has been destroying you for the past 10 hours, and its really not even joy its more like relief after being constipated for a week and finally blowing your sh**, painful but thank god its over.",Elden Ring

consider this game lucky for not being technically categorized as a sequel, despite it belonging to an outstanding genre with it's main attractiveness and majority of the content rendered disappointing in elden ring by poor rpg stats balancing, a very minor problem in this genre albeit magnified by an absent of progression pacing. the fine and tailored experience through a fixed difficulty which from software catered to players in previous titles no longer defines this game. this shift has led to a dilution of the tightly controlled difficulty curve that was a hallmark of from software's previous titles. the sense of accomplishment from overcoming meticulously designed obstacles is somewhat lost amidst the vast and sometimes uneven landscape of elden ring.

dlc sucks. they ampted up the enemies to the point you have to respect your character for every boss fight. plus added extreme aggro so you cant get a break at any point. plus added enemies that are immune to damage except when you parry them perfectly. parry is only available on certain shields!  not the same game that got initially released. only play if you want to hate your life or want to feel like your beating your head against a wall.,Elden Ring
"i'm glad other people are enjoying this game and the dlc. it's not for me.

i did the mash-my-face-into-the-boss thing, figured i was underleveled and explored everywhere i could. i went back to the boss and eventually won, but i didn't feel good about it; annoyed, actually. 

dodging the one or two hits that could send me back to the walk of shame doesn't feel good to me when life limits my time to learn the cues. ""playing it like an rpg,"" doesn't feel good to me when i still have to face the boss anyway and there isn't a major change in power dynamic between us. exploring doesn't feel good to me when i'm out of world to explore and hit the point of minimum returns while farming.

"== so since shadow of the eardtree for some odd reason has no leave review button / window / anything on its page im leaving this in here, until that section is fixed and i can properly migrate it to the dlc. == 

and before you read this, i'm not a hardcore fromsoft player. i'm a super casual player who really enjoyed er and loved the difficulty level there [summons and all that included]. 

elden ring was the 2nd fromsoft game i really fell in love with after sekiro. it was just right up my alley. not too ridiculously difficult but not a slouch either. amazing open world, mechanics, everything. so i thought man what a blast, a dlc to one of the most enjoyable games i've played. 

yeah... no. first credit where credit is due. music, art style, new weapons. bloody awesome.
the spamage of chonky enemies [who btw are trash enemies apparently] that decimate your hp like they are a boss ... not so much. yes, it gets a lil less ridiculous when you get the scadu fragments, but bosses? lol.. reminds me of what blizzard did at one point. ""we are out of cool ideas so lets just spam as many abilities as frantically as possible at the player"". yeah no. every bosss now has a ridiculous amount of fking arena wide skills that legit make your camera go fking bonkers. lot sof them for some reason have some sort of fking hellicoptah moves that have so much special effects you can't even tell whats going on. and thent heres the fking dragon. that dragon that only has 1 targetable point and its the head ??? and for some reason even if you're right under it you fking miss your swings  because your character is literally  ... too short ? honest to god. one of the worst fight i've had in my entire er carrier. granted the spectable is amazing.. the fight itself is a nightmare for a casualplayer.

all in all... i'm not enjoying the dlc at all. looks nice, sounds nice, plays bloody awful all around.  if you love frustration and wasting your time, you can safely get the dlc. but its a very different experience from the base game. and i simply cannot say that its like the base game or better. sadly no.  right now i'm just trying to finish ti for the sake of finishing it and i will probably never touch er again. this has soured my experience so much i'm pretty much done with it. i don';t mind difficulty. but most of the boss fights here are just ... not fun. 

and then there's the performance issues. ?been having a ridiculous amount of fps issues... and still no ultra-wide lol ... yeah. anyway.. back to the slog.",Elden Ring

"it's tough to critique this game and find grounds upon which i can convey what you want to convey. do i think this game is worth  trying? i do, but i thing it is past over rated. to its own detriment, because i know fromsoft might have tweaked some things if the audience actually cared to discuss the issues, instead of thinking of themselves as hardcore gamers for defeating the game.

elden ring feels to me like a food that you really enjoy at first with mild issues. you realize the flavor becomes too strong after a couple chews, and that it has some annoying bones, or that it makes some noises when you cut it with a knife, but it's negligible since the food is so delicious. but as you get familiarized with the food, you realize the strong flavor, the bones and the noises make up too much of the experience for you to really enjoy the delicious part of it.
elden ring is a good time at a wide angle, and yet has so many small disturbances that the experience goes past bitter.

straight to the point, the game hardly teaches you how to enjoy it, and wandering around leads to disgusting experiences. some casual enemies have way too much life, and they respawn so they game can easily turn into grind fest. the enemies that are not like that might as well be the absolute opposite and you just blow them instantly or run past them. these are mild annoyances that amount to too much of the experience for it to feel good.
if you play some specific builds, like str/fai, like dex, like int, and a couple others. the game is perfectly fine, the experience feels tailored and most bosses will at first be enjoyable, but even with said builds, a lot of encounters take so much time, that you eventually get burned out. this happens because a lot of factors. margit for example attacks way too much, radahn has an annoying size and giant confusing hitboxes, rennala is poking you while summoning shi. all of these fights have long times in between either because of the long attack patterns, or because the boss is making distance so you have to get close without carelessly getting open to an attack. and then you attack and the boss happens to have super armor in its vulnerable moments.

that's the thing about games where you are expected to die, shouldn't the game feel designed for replayability? but this game isn't, it's mostly focused on the show aspect of it all.
also, some attacks are really uncomfortable, and if you get the short end of the stick, you might get said move over and over again to where other people will say ""that fight was easy"", but they got the easiest attack pattern.

the game has almost none spectrum between piss easy and hard when it comes to those key fights. i could summon in commander neill and it was still hard but better than before. but when you summon against mohg, it all goes down the drain; either the summon is really good and can take him practically alone, or you're still dead because there's an attack you can't dodge.

in my opinion a lot of bosses have too much hp and dmg for no reason, like you realize the experience wouldn't have suffered if they weren't so pumped, quite the opposite. like, there's so much i have to say because this game has a lot of small issues that amount to a big dookie.

the game is worth playing, but it gets annoying and tedious, too much for it to feel worth it.",Elden Ring
"having loved elden ring and the souls series before it, i've finally hit my wall. this is, for me, not fun at all. 

why? because the challenge is unrelentingly brutal. having upgrades to help you survive in the world is a cool thing. it encourages you to search around and scrap by, harking back to one's first time playing a prior souls game. though instead of souls or equipment its an item that increases your stats by a percentage and one that buffs summons. the problem is even in your 150s and with some of these items, many early game bosses will kill you in too hits anyway. i know try hards will tell you using summons or tears is for weak peepee babies, but one of the two new upgrades is specifically for this, so it seems to expect players to lean on them.

speaking of bosses, the part i like the most, are the worst part. they are obscenely aggressive, so spell casting is super difficult, as you are bound to eat an attack. for posterity, i'm not just talking about one boss, all 4 i've faced so far have been like this. on top of that, half of them have an insane amount of health, so these fights become an endurance test. many people love to talk about ""you need to learn the bosses and get good"", but even when you do learn them, one screw up and you gotta do it all over again. when you finally do beat one you don't get that felling of pride when finally winning. instead, you get neurotic about finding more of that dlc leveling item so you can get creamed for 4 hours all over again with some other boss. i truly wish i could get a refund for this.

open world slop.  basically a ubisoft game.,Elden Ring
"this review is for the base game without the dlc.

so i have spent over 600h in elden ring across several vanilla playtroughs and several avalible overhauls (convergence, reforged and maybe even more idk). given my time spent in elden ring, it may be unusual that i am leaving it a negative review, or to be more precise i am not recommending the game (that's how steam contextualizes these reviews).

when i first played elden ring the experience with the game was excellent. at the time only other open world arpgs that i've played were bethesda games and ubisoft(ubislop) which elden ring even at it's worst exceeds in quality.  after playing elden ring i finished for the first time previous fromsoft titles, dark souls 3 and sekiro, which i liked a lot.

now that the dlc for elden ring has released i wanted to level a brand new character for the dlc. replaying elden ring with other fromsoft games fresh in the mind i realized just how bloated and empty the game feels compared to previously mentioned fromsoft games and that with elden ring fromsoft has really prioritized quantity over quality which is the opposite of their previous work. open world aspect that was added in elden ring adds pretty vistas and visuals at the tradeoff that the world is tedious to navigate. most dissapointing are the packs of trash mobs in the overworld which walk around as if the game was some shitty mmo (or god forbid ubislop) and not a delibarate hand made experience.

it was easy to recommend elden ring when ubislop games were the control that i was comparing the game to, but it does not compare well to previous games such as dark souls 3 and sekiro. if you are a new player that has not played any fromsoft titles before, i would highly recommend dark souls 3 and sekiro over elden ring as they provide more compact and quality focused experiences. i would recommend elden ring only if you really liked what those older fromsoft titles offered and want more, but be ready for a watered down experience which focuses more on quantity over quality.",Elden Ring

"elden ring is a perverse game for perverse people. 

perverse comes from latin: pervertere, to turn back. 

dark souls was an amazing game, because it was different. the mechanics of the game served immersion and the theme of the game. the themes of the game include: despair, futility, anxiety, hopelessness etc. you get the picture. the world is dying and full of dead people, trying to avoid their fate of turning hollow. the game was so original and immersive that people loved it. but there was a misunderstanding, it became a meme and the sales-pitch was that the game is hard. but being hard was not the point, the point was the experience of which being hard was a part of. 

the experience is so impact that people want to relive dark souls. but you can't relive it. you already had the experience and you can try to cling on to it, as i tried and countless people try. so when fromsoft came out with a more refined, pretty openworld dark souls. people were hypnotized by the promise. everyone want's to love it. so they will the game to be good. but they don't notice that their want for the game to be good is the only thing that makes the game good.

elden ring is trying to be dark souls. ds was hard so elden ring is more hard, ds had a lot of bosses so er has more bosses. ds had obtuse quests so er has even more obtuse quests. 

but when a game is trying to be a previous version of itself, but better it fails to be itself because it is trying to. dark souls was creative and took risks. but trying to simulate ds is not creative or risky. it's safe and predictable. dark souls 3 was already trying too hard to be ds1. elden ring has the mechanics of dark souls 3 with a few small additions. but ds3 was already pushing the limited mechanics with just making the bosses have longer combos and more awkward timings. so elden ring is hard by giving bosses even longer combos with more awkward timings. there is nothing new in the gameplay or game design, 90% of the enemies and bosses have existed in some form in a previous game. you deal with every boss the same way, you dodge 1-5 times and hit the boss 1-2 times, repeat. 

it is the same gameplay loop as every souls game. but doing the same thing for 13 years gets stale. people know that the combat is stale, but they are hypnotized by the illusion of a magnificent game, ""the new dark souls."" people want to cling on to the past, so they lie to themselves that they are having a good time. but the only fun in the game is working for some goal, you want the next weapon, you want to see the next boss. but when you have discovered most of the game, you might notice that you are just doing the same repetitive tasks, fighting the same repetitive bosses. you have some hope that there comes some moment that validates the whole experience, but it never comes. 

the real challenge of elden ring is to see past the illusion, notice that you cannot re-experience dark souls. and abandon trying to. then stop playing, orient yourself to the future and not the past. go to the unknown and do something new, instead of clinging on to 13 year old mechanics to fight 250 bosses over and over again doing the same thing. it's just so futile. 

creativity is doing something new, going into the unkown future, taking risks. elden ring is clinging on to the past,  making players cling to the past just to sell you the same thing. it's just so frustrating and futile.

"can't believe i never wrote a review originally. oh well.

miyazaki is washed. the game starts amazing, but by the back end it becomes unfairly difficult. getting killed in 1-2 hits is not fun. no souls game has ever done that before, and it's a pretty awful time. i also had been saying since launch that they clearly forgot to enable letting you use your horse during the final boss and were too embarrassed to add it back in too early when it would cause a pr stink. well, now they finally added it back in, which gives credibility to my criticisms of the game.

fights like the godskin duo try to recapture the magic of what ornstein & smough did 11 years prior. they recaptured the thunderous roar of that fight as a short, wet fart. it's dark souls 2 logic: ""what if we add multiple enemies to the encounter. that'll make it harder and please the toxic pissbabies who let us hide behind them from all criticism, right?"" only this time, miyazaki doesn't have a b team to push the blame on. real gamers­™ constantly criticize rockstar games' linear game design that requires you to do one specific thing to win. why are we treating godskin duo like they aren't also like that? essentially, the two bosses in the fight have their own individual health bars and one big health bar that they share. once the shared health bar depletes to zero, the fight ends. however, this does not mathematically correlate to their individual health bars. they will both die numerous times throughout this fight and then respawn. were fromsoftware still the genius avant-garde game devs they once were nigh over a decade ago, they would have made it so that depleting both of their health bars within a small window would prematurely end the fight, as one could not resurrect the other. but nope.

i ain't even getting into the fact that everything after leyndell is a bland, artificially difficult sadistic piece of trash. all i'll say is they should have cut out everything that comes after leyndell save for the haligtree, farum azula, and the final boss. it would have been a much much better game were that the case, and it would have been able to be about in 2021 too and have saved a lot of development time. elden ring is too big and too ambitious for its own good. it has many redeeming factors, particularly in its first half, its art design, and its lore, but the flaws make for a truly insufferable experience that is beloved by the worst, most obnoxious person with a superiority complex that you know.

"honestly i have to say from software is one of the best studios in the game industry at art, animation, and atmosphere. however, the gameplay has been the almost the exact same for their games for over a decade. sekiro was a huge step in the right direction, rewarding a more aggressive, in-your-face playstyle and an actually fleshed out narrative. instead this game is the same roll and light attack spam fest as it was in dark souls 3. bloodborne encouraged an aggressive playstyle as well. frankly, this game feels a lot like ds3-2 instead of a new game, and it shows with a lot of the same reused animations and enemies. making the game open world only exacerbates this problem and highlights the monotonous combat further, as the gameplay loop is pretty much the same thing the whole time and this is a long game. there is a huge imbalance in the weapons, and as you get later in the game you tend to rely on the same weapons with the same movesets in order to deal with damage sponges. the bosses in this game and especially the dlc aren't as fun as it could be, as you are almost always forced to be on the defensive and play reactively the whole time. i only wish they put as much effort in the player's moveset as the bosses. i hope from software reinvents their gameplay, as the ds3 style combat is now dated in my opinion.",Elden Ring

combat just isnt done. makes the game super difficult to recommend when 90% of interacting with the game is done through a combat system that makes no sense and is just broken. it's not a hard combat system, it's just not well designed. need updates asap but thats not happening.",Elden Ring

"i kind of hate this game, the armor looks cool, so do the weapons. the controls are awful and crampy, the camera sucks and is intentionally too slow and then slaps around on edges? the random lag is annoying, the input lag is annoying. i really wanted to like this game, and i finished all the achievements but the total lack of the laws of physics on some things and the complete enforcement on others is just goofy, like seriously just a long spear to the neck.",Elden Ring
"a game made for controllers, if you play on the keyboard, you will start to feel suicidal. you have to watch tutorials on how to play this game and how to build your character, and i don't know why they didn't include  watch mojo tutorials seen no one will explain to you how to progress in this game. 10/10 game my ass, go take some good mecanics from doom eternal .  f*uck you i will  see you tomorrow. ",Elden Ring
"this dlc is a huge step backwards! i feel like i'm dealing with the same artifical difficulty that was put into dark souls two. unresponsive controls make combat nearly impossible. it makes zero sense that something half your size can juggernaught through all your attacks, heavies included. to make things worse the bosses aren't even that much harder more than the dev just hid endless attack stings behind over the top animations that have you seeing more effects than actual gameplay. then you have the new system of finding collectibles to gain power which i understand why you players exploring but this system totally killed the post game as none of it matters. that is not a smart decision and needs to be reviewed in the next dlc. 

i get what from software was trying to do but this isn't it. they need to take it back to how vanilla was. it was fun to play but challenging enough to make the victories worth it. now i feel like i'm just catching lucky breaks or cheesing the fight. 

in summary. hidetaka miyazaki's over the top need to make the game hard is ruining a good thing. he needs to understand that making a game hard and making a game have cheap mechanics are two different things. you can have difficulty without the clear need to hinder everything about how you play the game. dmc5, monster hunter i could go one.",Elden Ring

"i do not have to justify my view that the dlc simply is not fun, but i will. 

1) the world is structured intentionally to obfuscate most (not a few) of the location of the areas. this results in general confusion. i'm often riding in circles, not getting anywhere until i pull up a guide online. 

2) the bosses are simply designed to be frustrating. they are not fun to play against. i am just sitting and waiting to have my turn to attack for a couple minutes. the saying that you die in dark souls because you run out of estus flasks, but you die in elden ring (and much more so here) because you get hit once in the middle of a 15 combo move is absolutely true. examples: mesmer just glides across half of the length of the arena to kill you in one stab. he also has many similiar looking moves that are just frustrating and boring to try to dodge. his snake forms have junk hit boxes (as does another hog riding boss). and the final boss is some kind of cruel joke. the move set is unfair and the rays of light obfuscate the screen to the point that i can't even see whats going on. i just do not see how this got past play testing. its like they didn't even play the bosses they were making.

3) there are also a great deal of mechanical issues - frame rate stuttering amongst others - that would not be acceptable for any game. kind of unbelievable that it launched in this state. i have a 3000 dollar gaming pc.

i simply cannot recommend the dlc. i very much enjoyed the base game and would recommend that anyone who has purchased the base game stick to that. if you absolutely need to purchase the dlc, wait a couple years until its on sale. by then they should have fixed the mechanical issues and nerfed all of the bosses to a point where they are enjoyable to fight. finally, i was not going to write this review, because i normally don't. but the fact that so many people are hating on people who negatively review the dlc because of these problems compelled me to put out my honest opinion, rather than pretend to enjoy this bad game dlc.",Elden Ring

"i absolutely loved the based game! i was looking forward to the dlc for so long, i was super hyped! but to my disappointment fromsoftware decided to say screw the casual gamer that enjoyed everything that made elden ring so great. instead of just building on top of the formula they had in elden ring base game for difficulty they decided to make it so that you have to practically beat every boss hit-less. god forbid if you take one hit that you will never have time to do anything else except dodge roll until your stamina bar depletes because there is literally no end to boss attack patterns. if you get hit by attack you will be stun locked and hit by every other attack. you can never heal or make an attack, hell you can't even summon a damn spirit ash at the beginning of most boss fights. i get that souls games are supposed to be hard but i would rather have dinner with hannibal lector and watch a movie with jeffrey dahmer than get a$$ f***ed by everything in this god forsaken dlc. i put hundreds of hours into this game trying new builds, trying out the different and cool mods that people made just to be told to go f*** myself by fromsoftware. until they fix this broken ass dlc elden ring can go suck my praetor rykard.",Elden Ring

"i enjoyed the main game, i expended 200 hrs on my ps5 on it (across years), then i even bought it for pc, unfurtunately the dlc is 100% garbage, this is what happens when you hurt the feelings of the developers by saying their game was too easy, they simply resort to one shot you on any boss fight, where you have to dodge, dodge and then dodge until you have a tiny window to strike back, i gave up on the eighth boss, i went out trying to find shards to level a bit, i found myself getting kill by any random dude on the field, really stressing game. 
elden ring orginal gave you the chance that at some point just be powerful enough by leveling, something that a none hardcore gamer like me will do, but the dlc traps you on the dynamic where no matter how many shards you get, they are numbered and have a limit, therefore you will be one shot anyway, thus forcing you to be very skillful, i think a better solution as a developer should have been by reseting your level and basically restart the game, then you will be able to re use your weapons at some point

that been said, i uninstalled the game to avoid further tentation, i got really estressed with the bosses, i must have died 100 times easily in that boss fight, so i did not lack the tries, but i was not really enjoying the game like the first one and that is pretty unfurtunate since i was really waiting for this dlc",Elden Ring

"things i don't like in the game.

input reading.

flashy moves that are so fast that players are unable to see what even hit them.

on some bosses the camera is downright atrocious.

larval tears (respec regent) is limited in number for no intelligent reason.

on a similar note, not being able to fully upgrade every weapon is not ideal. is there a real reason for this? seems to me the game would be just as good if not better if you could purchase the final smiting stone or somber stone to upgrade the weapon fully.

the sizes of some enemies are too large for the speed at which they move. the bears in particular. large (attack reach), fast and relentless = not fun at all.

delayed attacks are kind of a bad game mechanic. this is because it messes with the rhythm which is not a good thing imo.

malenia literally cheats as a boss. she cancels staggers. her waterfowl dance is poorly designed. it is the flashy ability mentioned above. it happens so fast that they player cannot even see what she is actually doing. as such, most people need to go onto youtube to learn the fight via a guide instead of being able to learn on their own.

this is made even worse when combined with the input reading mentioned above. she activates this ability the exact frame that you swing a sword, making it impossible to do anything about it as after you are staggered by the first strike, its almost impossible if not completely impossible to dodge or block the second flurry without dying.

another thing that i don't like is the hyper armor mechanic. this is essentially there to give input reading teeth. this is because the ai starts the animation on the same frame as your swing, but if they didn't have hyper armor your swing would still stagger them. to make sure input reading works, they give the ai hyperarmour, killing the player even though they struck first.

large enemies, like giants and dragons. i think its stupid that we have to swing at their feet. i believe that such fights should require bows. make bows more useful. have ammo be purchasable. have a weakpoint around the head of the giant or dragon that needs to be hit by an arrow. swinging at the feet is a lame i believe.

i am a pc player and i believe the inventory system is bad. having to cycle between items is not ideal when compared to the fast pace of the game.
simply having a button to activate the pouch and then mapping a second button to a specific item, ie flask would make things better i think instead of having to cycle between your whole pouch.

mapping dash and roll on the same button is not ideal.
sometimes this causes to do the opposite of what is intended ie dashing instead of rolling or the opposite.
the fact that there is no option to separate the two is the problem. if you bind them together by default its ok if the player can change the bind for each individually, but they dont have that option.

when your horse dies in battle, you can revive it by using a flask. what is really bad is that it opens up a yes or no prompt for this. ""would you like to use a flask to resurrect torrent? y/n"" that is incredibly dumb. time is of the essence when i'm fighting a dragon, why do i have to waste it my time to click yes? i would not have clicked on it if didn't have the intention to use it. had i miss clicked it would be on me, if i die in fire while i'm struggling with this bad menu its on the game developers. this could had been patched out but the game has been out for 2 years. why is this still a thing?

i think hidden mechanics are stupid. for example the diminishing returns of stat upgrades. why are there diminishing returns at, say 30, which are then removed when you get to 40, only to once again be added when you reach 50 of a particular stat. why is this a thing compared to linear stat increases?

i hope they improve it in future games, but i highly doubt it they will do anything about it.",Elden Ring

"tldr: should you play it? yes. do i, personally, like it? not really.

i've played and enjoyed every other souls game, including bloodborne, sekiro, and demon's souls. and, in my opinion, this game isn't nearly as good as ds3, bloodborne, or sekiro (my top 3). why? everyone else seems to enjoy it thoroughly. 

well, when i first started playing elden ring, i was enraptured. like everybody else. but the albeit very pretty visuals are a great distraction for the extremely mediocre gameplay. 

just in terms of your own character, there's an obnoxious action queue window that isn't present in other games. a lot more attacks in elden ring seem well equipped to catch rolls, and this is partially on the fault of the action queue, where if you get hit right before you roll, then in most cases your character just immediately rolls once the hitstun concludes. a similar story with consecutive player attacks, and et cetera. it gives the game an exceedingly clunky feel.

in terms of actual boss and enemy design, most enemies in the entire game have multiple of these attributes:
- way too much health and/or damage (this occurs in virtually every dlc enemy)
- obnoxious projectiles/fire breath
- constantly jumps around the arena/runs away
- way too much shit going on to follow what the enemy is doing
- has a oneshot attack of some kind
- too many attacks too quickly

it's just not fun. the game doesn't make me want to get better at it, the game makes me want to stop playing the game. i'm aware i'll just be told to ""get good"" by the community, but the poor gameplay is not an issue i usually have with fromsoft games. so many bosses feel like they would be 5000% better if the game had a sekiro-esque parry system (in some cases like malenia, it's partially because they literally just ripped sekiro anims for their moveset.)

i have plenty of other issues with the game (such as the dlc, like the main game, being excellent visually and awful gameplay-wise, the generally terrible weapon system (they learned nothing from bloodborne), torrent feeling bad to control and being unable to use in some areas, the map being bad/inaccurate and how you can't open your map in combat, and the completely nonsensical lore) but i don't care to talk about them in length. ultimately, and reluctantly, i must recommend the experience, for nothing more than to experience more fromsoft content, and statistically, whoever is reading this review is far more likely to enjoy the game than i am. i just don't like it, and don't think it's particularly fun or special.",Elden Ring

"despite this being a negative review, this is to highlight the more long-term problems with the dlc, and some others that the game has possessed for a while. the dlc is *very* good, and more worth it than most modern games even after bumped down to the same price range.

but there are *four* problems in specific, one of which is sote specific.

1. scadutree blessings

on paper, its an interesting idea. to reiterate what they are: they are items that you need to ""level up"" for the dlc's specific frame of leveling. these can boost your numbers *quite* substantially, moreso than basic equipment upgrades or even levels can. sekiro had something like it, and it was generally enjoyed -- or not cared about -- there. but sekiro is a comparatively linear, more mechanically-minimalist game than elden ring is, being more along the lines of a character action game than a widely open-ended rpg. here, there are *so* many of them, and *so* many blessings. people will say ""this incentivizes exploration."" but elden ring already did that. either by having a variety of items to find -- oftentimes said items were of the quest/key variety -- or going in whichever direction you want to gain levels. both of these things are a strength of the base game, especially as the former are generally in rare and more obviously-located supply. moreover, npc questlines often dictated if there would even *be* something in a corner of the game world. while scadutree fragments are *generally* found at golden crosses, many others are dropped by somewhat unassumingly-designed enemies, that are often placed into basic foliage and enemy-filled fields, which they may blend into. many people consider several of the bosses in this, even with scadutree blessings, to rank among the hardest in the developer's catalog. this raises two questions: if bosses are going to be that hard anyways, then what's really the point of having this new power system, besides stalling the early game? secondly, now it's not ""i have to go level up"" or ""keep trying a boss until i get better at it."" it's ""i have to now go scrape the corners of the game world, possibly so i can even stand a chance."" in the basegame you had choice of what you wanted to farm for levels. here, you may have to pull up a googled checklist if you're not agonizingly thorough. this effectively will hamper replay value, as it will no longer be ""just explore"" on replays -- it will be ""do the checklist,"" ontop of the existing checklist baked into the games core. the basegame could effectively be mostly ignored, and that was one of its strengths. all in all, scadutree fragments remind me of the mmo-style ""borrowed power"" system. anyone who knows that is groaning reading this. borrowed power was a system where, at the end of each expansion, you lost the power you had last expansion that you only gained through tremendous grinding. moreover, on alt-characters, it made you have to redo the whole grinding experience again just to do the content your other characters can do. in some cases, you even sort of lost it with each patch. in effect, it made the levels and gear you did have seem like they didn't really matter. most mmos have removed this system by now, or streamlined it, or still have it as sticking points to great expansions. now why is this in the expansion? to make sure that it's hard? levels after a *certain point* effectively stop mattering, and most players would be *around* that point anyways. it would already be very hard if you set the difficulty *for* that level range. moreover, the game has baked-in ways to make it hard, like ng+, not using summons, or special ""debuff"" rings. or, just, not levelling, or going effectively naked. scadutree blessings are unnecessary that in the long-term are a chore, and other mediums of this scope -- which were built *for* these systems -- have proven these systems redundancy.

2. boss design

some of these bosses, like rellana, are astounding. but we're quickly reaching a point where the developer can't *do* really anything else to keep making encounters ""harder."" people already have griped about bosses doing their flips and acrobatics and 15-hit rush-attack chains, but i don't think anyone's yet elaborated on *why* this is so much of a problem. bloodborne and sekiro gave you the speed to constantly trade with the boss, or built-in tools to effectively stop almost any boss in their tracks. here, it still *plays* like dark souls, and you even have a load of super cool weapons and spells with really elaborate combo's, but you effectively can't use them. either the bosses never stop moving, or you can't stagger anything worth enough to get more than one hit in. without the mechanics of poise -- and a defense value on gear that matters -- heavy builds are subject to ""just backpedal until you hit them once."" super light weapons like daggers seem effectively pointless compared to a straight sword, outside of the sparse few times you may land a crit -- for which there are already rings to better facilitate. as a bow user myself, the only real effective way to use a bow in a boss -- normal, not greatbow -- is to just spam rain of arrows, or just keep jumping backwards while shooting. bloodborne gave bosses -- like the cleric beast -- weak spots you could shoot or throw grenades at, and this would cripple the boss in some way -- also allowing for an easy crit. that doesn't really exist here, and even if it did, bosses move around too much to make the shot feasible or worthwhile. all the ""hard"" bosses effectively play the same in this regard. they rarely stand out anymore. it feels like fromsoftware has played all its hands if it keeps wanting to go in this direction, and if they're adamant about not adding the convenience the other games provided. we all by now probably know about the popularity boost kai cenat gave this game. the strategies he often used -- just spamming one weapon art on a good weapon every fifteen or twenty seconds -- are far too commonplace and far too necessary.

3. patches

i don't mean the npc, he's a real one. no, i mean how fromsoftware games have started to treat their patches like destiny 2 patches. prime example in *this* dlc: hoarfrost stomp. used to be super good. is still *very* good. but one of the new stomp-based attacks, effectively, is just what hoarfrost stomp was pre-nerf. why would they even bother, then? at least destiny 2 has a live-service element to it, and even still, that's *still* scummy there. moreover, weapon values like, again, lighter weapons, have had their poise damage value on enemies reduced. some of the lighter enemies, then, effectively have movement frames that effectively nullify the value of these lighter weapons -- being able to hit and shut down enemies that move a lot -- compared to something akin to a straight sword. thislive-service-like balancing is confusing more than anything else. nerfing things just because you'll add something better in a dlc or patch, is effectively just planned obsolescence. the multiplayer component of this game is not *that* big of a focus, despite what the community will say, so that's not much of an excuse either. buildcrafting is what *makes* replays of these games. 

4. invasions

the system is breaking. being able to only really invade groups, means you have no reason to face them head-on. ds3 had the invader sunbros. why is this not back? alternatively: a system to queue into an ""invasion lobby"" with others. or, hell, just let a solo invader use a summon. instead, outside of community-imposed dueling arenas, invasions are just both parties standing there until one side gets bored enough to leave, the invader commits kms, or the invader needs cheese strats. with the invader continuously running, something like a battle royale ""timed death wall"" is needed to force both parties to come together to just fight each other and stop wasting each others time. or, at least, something like giant tree seeds from 2.",Elden Ring
"i'd rather kill myself than recommend a game where the only reason anything is hard is because the devs decided to troll people with doors that mobs get caught on and you can't shoot through or some other random bug that kills you rather than genuine difficulty. it's like stellar blade and the subway car that rolls over you non-stop... elden ring is a trolley car running over you over and over again and saying haha i played a practical joke on you. practical jokes take zero intelligence to create. a practical joke could be pushing someone down stairs... troll this, bitches... imagine being so fucking dumb you thought it was fucking cool to block ultra-wide for everyone 'cause you're that fucking disconnected from real life...",Elden Ring

"anything that is good about this game is ruined by the frustrating boss battles. game is difficult for the sake of being difficult, nothing is fair. bosses have next to no stamina limit and one shot you, dlc takes it to beyond ridiculous limits. get one r1 hit and then dodge for 20 minutes hopping not to get one shot or staggered to death, but you die anyway because you have no clue about the second phase move set or some bs one shot move which requires frame perfect dodges, but wait, you think you can dodge? no because input reading. so basically long boring unfair boss battles which are a mixture of trial and error with luck, nothing about that process is fun. i had more fun playing dark souls 2 and i find tekken easier than this game.",Elden Ring
"crucible knight and misbegotten are like aids, fuck you miyazaki",Elden Ring
"let me preface this by saying this entire review is strongly based on my own personal enojoyment of from soft games and not everyone will agree. as game elden ring is masterpiece, it is incredibly well made with almost zero bugs. it has thousands of hours of content with a huge open world that can be played in so many different ways. the level design is amazing, some of the best levels in video game history, every legacy dungeon looks amazing and has so many hidden details and lore, one legacy dungeon from elden ring is better then most entire games. it looks amazing, runs smooth, and the build varitiy is astounding, they're so many cool weapons to play with. this game is ever green, one of the best video games made period. it was last forever and is peak of video games as far i see. every game in genre should be compared too and learn from fromsoft. 

the reason i said all that above is because i believe it, elden ring is a masterpiece yet one singular aspect that keeps me playing other souls games is completely ruined. the boss fights and gameplay. fromsoft has gained a reputation for making ""hard"" games, what orginally was supposed to a way of telling the story, quickly turned into the main draw. fromsoft games are hard so mastering them becomes rewarding. this is quite literally baked into the dark souls 1 story, if you give up, quit because a boss was to challenging, you are a hollow. if you get through it you become the chosen undead. this has proven to be nothing more then a massive road block and ruins elden ring. fromsoft has tried to hard to keep up their reputation of being hard games they created boss and enemy design that is mechanically not fun to play. they have never adpated to a different system, they've stuck with the roll, attack style of game play loop. they used it for 5 games in a row and everytime they run into the same problem, the only way to make the game harder is to make the game play loop harder.

attack in this game are no longer well telegraphed, have intuitive design, have a core theme around them. every single bosses needed random attacks to be delayed, come up super fast, have huge magical aoe effects on everything, apply a status effect. boss fight attack are deigned first to trick the player rather then to create an interesting encounter. they make attacks so well timed they punish roll spamming to the exact frame just to kill you faster. because that's what player wanted right? we like dying in dark souls games. no we didn't we liked dying because death was something we could improve on. they this concept to the extreme by making it so you have to die to a boss many times to even understand what it's doing. so many bosses attack for so long and so often you're not even allowed to play the video game for half the time. dark souls 1 and 2 bosses would at most have a 3-4 hit combo once in a while. elden ring basic mobs have upwards of 8-12 attack combos. it just memorization and not actual skill. in dark souls 1 if you saw an enemy raise a sword at you, one could easily tell when and how to dodge it. logically if you see someone raising a sword you know that has weight and cannot be maintained so it has to drop at some point, you can see the mobs arms dropping and arcing downwards so you know when to dodge the slash. elden ring knows this an goes against the design just to make it harder. if an enemy is raising a sword to slash at you it's complete luck as to know when they'll swing it. it could be instant or they make a slight motion on slash only a randomly hold their stance for 0.5 just to trick you. it's like their is a check list of hard moves to dodge that from has and every boss needed to tick a certain amount before it can be a boss. it needs to have delayed attacks, need huge aoe attacks, needs long combos, needs roll punishes, need healing or spell casting punishes. it makes the game un fun to play. in dark souls 1 for the most part you and the enemy were the same. you roughly do the same things with the same power level. if you failed your attack you get punished if the enemy failed their attack they get punished. that just is not true anymore. elden ring bosses will do dragon ball z anime combos that have them fly and twirl in the air sending hundrerds of magic blasts at you with infinite stammina with massive aoe blasts flooding the screen with effects and then only then can you maybe get one hit off. not to mention the fact that every boss need to a stat monster that 1-2 shots you  if are level playing field. they made bosses to unfun to play against they literally give you the option to summon an ally that draws aggro for you. lets you upgrade them and create op spells or skills that can safely kill them. the casual player nowadays does not even attempt to play the game, they just summon allies sit back and spam ranged magic with maximized stats because trying to fight these bosses is terrible. it's not fun getting one shot, it's not fun having bosses input read so you have run across the map just to heal, it's not fun fighting bosses that can dash or teleport top you in 5 frames, it's not fun fighting something with hotboxes so large the cover most of the entire arena. every boss need to be more, have more spectacle, have more gimmicks, do more damage, have more health, every boss need a phase transition that looks epic. 

that's not the reason i liked play the souls games, bosses where supposed to be challenging to make it feel rewarding. i don't feel rewarded after killing any boss in elden ring. the entire time fighting them i bored out of mind having my skillset locked because i cannot play any other way then dodging at the right time and getting one single hit in every 10 seconds. it's no wonder every player looks how to get op fast! videos on youtube or use op magic, or use any tatic at all to empower themselves. it's because these bosses are not fun. they tried so hard to upkeep their reputation as a hard video game that they've failed to make it fun. it's not fighting them at equal level nor it is fun over statting them. for all it's years of development time, hunrderds of thousands of hours of man power, millions in costs to be made, i genuinely cannot think of single boss i enjoy fighting more then any of the previous games. i re played dark souils 3 out of nowhere just because i wanted to fight midir and gael. two bosses made me play another 40 hours of that game of which i beaten 5 times. i do not think about a single boss in elden ring. i don't want to spend 50 hours roaming the open world and google the one specific piece of loot i need to make a proper build. it feels like i need to spend 10 hours just start the game because while this amazing and huge open world makes it fun to explore when you've already explored it all, it then turns into a choir. they've strayed away from what made dark souls game special. they keep getting bigger, more epic, more everything and missing the basic fundamentals of making a good game. so many brain dead players will just shout get gud! because they cannot take any critisicm of their beloved game and attach themselves to it. trust me i've played these game for decades i've done more challenge runs then you can even think of and yet i have zero interest in coming back to play this. i came back for the dlc expecting it to better as fromsoft always improves their games with dlc, only to find out they made an entire new system that forces you explore the world for specific items because they made bosses so over tunned and over statted these new items give masssive stat boosts only in the dlc. if that doesn't show the problem i don't know what will. trying playing your beloved game with out and having to spend 10 minutes fighting a boss that will one shot you at every singe mistake. i'd love die hard fans play through that and tell me they don't see a problem. but knowing them they just google the location of all the items anyways.",Elden Ring
"the dlc ruined this game for me. it has so many dogshit designs. its not difficult, its just boring. spamming 10 ranged enemys in addition to your boss that can 2 tap you with heavy armor isnt hard, its boring, random and infuriating. it doesnt feel like its my fault i died. same thing with puzzles in the dlc. they dont make sense. even less than normal darksouls puzzles and storylines. how the fuck am i  supposed to figure out, that i have to die 4 times in the same way before something happens? i just cant with this dlc anymore. i wish i never played it. it honestly ruined my experience with this otherwise brilliant game. 

also, the messages have become just plain unfunny and annoying. ""horse ahead"" isnt funny guys. its just annoying.",Elden Ring
"not a big fan of action games so far tbh but the camara, lag, and overall combat is bad, just spam dodging while bosses look fancy and have cool animated attacks",Elden Ring
"everything works as intended, miyazaki is just a giant troll.",Elden Ring
"maybe there is some greatness i`m missing... but i just hate it
i hate feel of open world
i hate vigor check bosses with attacks that take so long you can make some tea, watch whole lore of dark souls series, take a nap and then dodge
i hate the setting with that fucking tree, and fingers or what not
and most important... i hate local fashion, or absence of one? however hard i try, i just cant find  armor i could call beautiful or even slightly cool

i`m sorry elden ring, i can`t find a reason to love you :c",Elden Ring
"unnecessarily difficult, not much fun. obviously made for certain group of players.",Elden Ring
"stutters uncontrollably, poor compataility, looks bad in game at 2k. my pc is idling and its bad. refundingtill they fix dlc bug.",Elden Ring
fix mesmer's fucking hitboxes holy shit,Elden Ring
"i wondered why the reviews re mixed, now i know, the game is amazing, looks amazing aand the new weapons designs are a chefs kiss but how hard they hit, the amount of health the enemys have, doesnt matter how much vigor you have, the dlc is stupidly unbalanced, you are but an ant to be trampled on. melania was easy compared to the two hitting anything in this dlc, gave it a go, not for me, good luck to you, ima stick to elden ring pre-dlc",Elden Ring
"if this is the level of difficulty you need to enjoy a game or find it challenging then take a break from gaming. after 300 hours in base i am tired of bashing my head against the wall on new dlc bosses. it no longer a fighting game and is just ddr. hit this button on this exact tempo at this exact time. rinse and repeat until you ""learn the boss"" which is just hoping to get one hit in after 5 minutes of chasing and dodging while they iceskate in mid air all over the map. i know these games are supposed to be challenging but at what point do they stop being fun and just feel like you and sprinting against someone who is in a car and you are in quicksand?",Elden Ring
"i will flip my vote as soon as you add wide screen support, this is beyond stupid, you are literally blocking the view on both sides with black panels instead of allowing me to use my whole screen",Elden Ring
"evasion when the focus is on the boss or any other captured target does not work correctly, i die from my own skill of the action of the bloodhound in 100 times more than from errors related to gameplay. thank you very much that evasion works in the exact opposite direction",Elden Ring
got banned for no reason due to a glitch after 100 hours. thanks fromsoft.,Elden Ring
i've never seen a worse camera control in a game ... and every thing is tied to its position,Elden Ring
bloated and unfocused. given the pretty yet highly flawed and repetitive it only makes sense that it's made by the dark souls 2 guy. i hope miyazaki makes a game for dark souls fans one day.,Elden Ring
"great game already have one playthrough on ps5! bought it on pc for better graphics but it doesnt have ultrawide support....
that sucks... half of my screen is black.. and i dont want to use a mod cuz i want to play with others ...

"this second time in a week i got kick of game with "" inappropriate activity detected "" . have to verify game again to play . wtf fix your goddamn game",Elden Ring
"not saying anything about the game play, just noting the facts.
to have 21:9 work you need to heavily mod the game, as it is forced disabled with features that block you from having it work.
to have the game work properly on an amd gpu you also will need to search your issues and change ini settings and other modifications to files ect, to have the game function.
the fact that i have spent ages trying to get the game to function, i would not suggest it to people who have amd gpu and ultrawide screens unless you really want to play.",Elden Ring
"new dlc update completely butchered the performance even outside the dlc areas (i.e. in the base game) making the game pretty much unplayable, when it worked perfectly fine beforehand.",Elden Ring
"these are my feelings towards the game so far:
i wish i saw what everybody sees in this game, but i don't. everybody criticizes ubisoft for making ""go from point a to point b and then to point c to finish a checklist"" games, but elden ring is like that too, so that's some real double standards right here. bosses are rather unfun and sometimes unnecessarily hard (it's supposed to be a hard game, i get it, but sekiro didn't have a problem like this, i enjoyed almost every boss fight and never thought something was unfair). i don't see any environmental storytelling in this game, did i miss something? 
i will continue to play, maybe i will change my mind, maybe i just need to change playstyles, or maybe the game is just not for me",Elden Ring
too hard this game sucks,Elden Ring
"game is great, main game is very good. 

shadow of the erdtree however is plagued with the same performance issues the game had at launch. lagging, stuttering and freezing, regardless of graphic settings, just isn't acceptable for any aaa but particularly for one that is as input/reaction dependant as fromsoft games.",Elden Ring
"very good 350 hours of playtime, then the 1.12 patch made my game crash on startup (linux/proton.) will refund the dlc if it doesn't get fixed in the next 1-2 weeks, because i literally can't play the game anymore.

if you're on linux/proton, you probably can't play this game right now.",Elden Ring
"i wouldn't buy for pc until they get the performance issues figured out. if you are going to charge full price for a port, at least invest in making it perform on the pc as well as it does on the (much less powerful) playstation",Elden Ring

the fallen leaves tell a story. about the great age of stuttering.,Elden Ring
"dont get it if u get mad cuz bad

its not linear or story driven. it doesn't hold your hand whatsoever, arguably it pushes you over the cliff as a player.

10/10 will be playing every dlc",Elden Ring
"i do not recommend this dlc, not because it is too hard, but because the story is bad and won't spoil. also, this is a horrible map that is too difficult to navigate due to a lack of clarity of how to get from most places to others, whick a lot of the time requires you to find a hidden mini dungeon to progress, which is what you spend most of your time doing, which compounds with the problem that if the game is too hard, gathering the resources to make it more balanced requires you to search this horrible map, which of the third has nothing for you, which is the opposite of the based game, which has something no matter where you go. another problem is the again-resulted bosses from the dlc and base game. while there are quite a lot of new bosses, most of them are placed several times around the map, which reduces the pleasure of defeating them after seeing them again and again. ",Elden Ring
"im fine with the game difficulty.  it is supposed to be difficult so im statisfied.

however, please fix the stutter issues! it's like the release of the base game; it's not properly optimised for pc.",Elden Ring
"as much as this game is hyped up and has some serious curb appeal with the art style & world building/lore. the game runs like trash even on high end pc's. fromsoft is more worried about packing in drm & denuvo anti-cheat causing the game to stutter during combat. poor advanced graphical options and no dlss or fsr support in 2023/24 for a modern game. the developer can add these things at a near zero cost... and greatly increasing quality of game-play experience for everyone.

game menu's are just horrible to navigate, something out of 2007 type stuff... and trying to co-op play with a friend is a pure roll of the dice if its works at all or if its a lag fest. it should not be this difficult to co-op play with a friend. their co-op game-play isn't really a true co-op. your progression is all tied to your solo game-play and doesn't support any true co-op features like other games do. the game should have some type of disclaimer about their version of 'co-op'.

character & stories are very interesting at least.",Elden Ring

they set the game to max hard mode got to the final boss walk in summon boss opening attack he uses 90 percent of start of fight loss 75 percent of life die 5 seconds later only managed to get him past first phase tried using summons for the dlc the die way to quick even with the scadutree both maxed out,Elden Ring

dude this game makes me want to kill myself all the fuckin time but its so rewarding to beat a boss that has been shitting down ur throat but its very rare,Elden Ring
this is so hard. i died 14 times to the haredest boss in the game (soldier of godrick) never playiong again hawk tuah !,Elden Ring
this game is awful and feels dead,Elden Ring
the dlc has some annoying as hell bugs that make the enemy's  unenjoyable to fight,Elden Ring
i got banned for zero reasons and now i can't play the game with my friends,Elden Ring
new patch fuc*ed up the performance it constantly shutters plus it shutters the computer and i dont even own the dlc,Elden Ring
"i love the original game, but from needs to relax with some of the bosses in dlc. they rush in and pummel you with speed, huge hits and no way to defend, heal, or counter.
it's a little excessive and i consider myself pretty good at this game. there is a fine line between punishing players and encouraging strategy and this is not strategy.",Elden Ring
"loved the game. absolutely loved it. after beating the game, i haven't touched it in years until the dlc came out. only to find out that a majority of my grace sites have disappeared. and i wasted money on your dumb ass fucking dlc. fuck this. i want a refund. i am going to get a refund. i do not have time to activate all the grace sites again just to get to the area i need to get to, to play this fucking dlc. go fuck yourself fromsoftware.",Elden Ring
game ran well until i installed the update just now. i dont even have the dlc just the base game. a lot of lag and stutter,Elden Ring
game makes me want to kill myself ;) dlc hitboxes r insanely good,Elden Ring
returned to the game after 2 years… and it’s still clunky and runs like sh*t. bravo.,Elden Ring
"game won't let me play online anymore. getting ""inappropriate activity"" error after not having done anything. the only inappropriate activity is fromsoft actively degrading the quality of my purchase.",Elden Ring
this game isnt good. making things annoying isnt making the game hard. a rat should hit harder than a dragons breathe. multiple bugs and crashes. almost one of the worst multiplayer experiences to deal with. so many reused assets. final boss isnt new. new weapons and armor are mid. shadowlands.....more like empty lands. back and fourth through tedious geographical puzzles,Elden Ring
"i'm only leaving a bad review as i'm experiencing graphics stuttering issues when playing the game, games great otherwise, once they fix the stuttering issues (that i know alot of other people are experiencing, not just myself), i will happily change this review back to a positive as the game is actually really good.",Elden Ring
game runs worse than cyberpunk day 1 buggy ah controls idk why people think this game is good,Elden Ring
i rather playing dark souls 2 than playing elden ring,Elden Ring
for the dlc. only buy if you enjoy dodging boss attacks for 40 seconds at a time perfectly to get a single fast attack in. good luck dodging since every boss attack is a delayed aoe attack.,Elden Ring
i am going to be completely honest. this game is a masterpiece and the new dlc is god tier. but holy shit the performance is ass. why sully this god tier game by releasing the dlc and basically making the game have the same issues as on launch? the performance issues even have leaked into the main game which means they clearly messed something up. will be keeping as negative until i dont have to add an extra 50 tries on bosses because of run ending fps issues,Elden Ring
"what is even the point of this game?! holy fuck people are troling or maybe all the rest of aaa crap is so bad that this game looks good.
kids, remember, pirate games first to see if you like or not, it can save you a lot of frustation.",Elden Ring
   this game fucking sucks fucking ass,Elden Ring
worst game ever the bosses to easy,Elden Ring
"i'm not being polite about this. the rest of the game is fine but the dlc has  problems, the scaling is terrible. everything deals too much damage, to anyone saying ""just be better"" your opinion is bad. the miquella fight is terrible, all of the others are fine but miquella needs a nerf for me to even begin to consider this dlc even decent. singelhandedly ruined my enjoyment of the rest of the dlc.",Elden Ring
"at no point did this game not feel like a chore, i tried my absolute best to have fun but i've finally accepted that i flushed $80 down the drain buying the game and dlc and i'm throwing in the towel. if someone recommends that you play elden ring, assume that they're an uninteresting person with no real hobbies.",Elden Ring

terrible too much damage taken in the dlc,Elden Ring
"cannot recommend due to shader stutters. i get that it gets better over time, but the beauty of a game like this is the first time you discover something, the feeling you get is amazing. however, the pc port's shader compilation stutters really negatively affects a first playthrough. i don't know how it cannot have been fixed after all this time.",Elden Ring

constant attacking bosses with one shot mechanics that can't be dodged.....can't recommend that.,Elden Ring

you know what i really want to play after a hard shitty week at work? a game that has unavoidable attacks that do 70% of my health. if only i knew that before i spent an extra $50. two controllers later and i decided to put this game down and play something else worth my limited time to play games as a normal working man. must be nice to get paid to play games and stay on a boss for half a day. when i can get lucky to spend an hour to play a game and this is what i get? thanks elden ring. don't change a fuckin thing!!!!!!!!,Elden Ring
"from software: if you don't want mouse and keyboard players to play your stupid friking game, then don't friking port it ffs. but, if you are going to take our damned money, then spend at least half of one goddamned afternoon to make it actually viable instead of continually releasing the world's dumbest m/kb schematics that can't be properly customized.

"it's tough to say, but overall, the game is a must-play. the lore and gameplay, combined with the massive world, are amazing. 
the reason i cannot recommend this is coop issues on top of the 180 'ban' system. i peer-pressured a buddy of mine to get the game so that we could play together and make it to the dlc, and he agreed. i re-installed the elden ring, as i have not played in the year-plus. well, behold, i have this 180-day timeout thing going on, and when i reached out to the company, they told me, ""get fucked. wait till 180 days."" i assume i must be for a 3rd party program i have on my pc, as this is my work pc on top of it being personal, and maybe something faulty in the system?",Elden Ring
the dlc contains some of the worst designed bosses in the entirety of the series. pretty amazing how they just decided to forget how to make a good fight.,Elden Ring
"i just think it's a dark souls 3 game in open world. it's not really that special. great time killer though, but i wouldn't recommend it unless you are vulnerable to social manipulation",Elden Ring
"kinda bland, kinda boring. wants you to explore but doesnt really reward it well, and feels like the devs focussed on quantity of areas rather than the quality the other souls games got",Elden Ring
"any game where the most important and most used ability (dodge) triggers only on its keybinds release, instead of its keybinds press, and you can't change it in the settings anywhere is a thumbs down for me. they decided to make their whole game feel clunky and unresponsive to combine a couple actions into one button, and you can't change it. what a disaster.

this is also the worst pc port for a big developer that i have ever seen. instead of using mouse buttons to navigate your inventory like how any other program or application works on a pc, you navigate your inventory using q and e. and you can't change it in the settings. this is just one example of how nothing about the ui for mouse and keyboard is intiutive at all. defualt settings are basically unusable, and you can't change most of it. i've never seen anything like this.",Elden Ring
"the fact this game uses easy anticheat and still has not had its performance issues fixed after 2 years is enough for me to give it a negative review. a good game, but some of the worst optimization for pc from software has ever done.",Elden Ring
"wildly unbalanced masochistic affair. difficulty for the sake of difficulty is lame. artificially difficult bosses, and by that i mean they're not difficult mechanically, they just ate buffed to the moon",Elden Ring
"as a piece of provocative art, this is a magnificent achievement. sublime. it is deeply philosophical and very moving. the design and writing in this game will keep you playing. it deserves all the praise and it really is that special. people fall in love with this game. me included. 

this is despite, not because, of the game mechanics itself. people will try to tell you otherwise. it's a sort of willing blindness to the game's quirks and deficiencies because of the awe the world built within it inspires.

as a piece of art, it is a masterpiece. as a game, it is hot garbage. i mean it.

this is why:

1) do you like mashing buttons and wondering why nothing is happening --- regardless of how much stamina is left in your meter? i hope so, because you'll be doing a lot of this! and even better, it is impossible to tell when your input is just being ignored or your character will eventually get to doing everything you asked 30 seconds ago while the boss has changed tactics and left your earlier deferred action worse than irrelevant. you're then left helpless while the boss does several combos in a row, tearing you apart.

2) ever driven a 20 year old uhaul truck across the country because it's all you could get in time to move? that's how controlling this game feels. every action takes forever, including using healing potions. while your character is giving the healing process all the urgency of a pleasant tea party with aristocracy, every enemy on screen will corner you and pummel you to hell, leaving you sitting for entire minutes waiting for the inevitable. all the actions are so telegraphed and slow that you have to plan ahead -- and sometimes, you just can't learn on the fly fast enough and have no opportunity to change course.

3) do you love watching the camera angle blur the entire screen to the point you can't see anything in the middle of a complicated battle? well you're in luck if you pick this game! at least a solid quarter of the times i've died in this game, i've had no idea why because there's just too much jumbled mess on the screen to make anything out and i'm just about seasick while trying to figure it out. 

4) do you really appreciate it when what is visibly on screen has little relation to what actually matters? well, elden ring has your back here again! go ahead and dodge out of the range of a magic or melee attack. even if it looks like you're several steps away from the area of damage, you get hurt anyway! be it blast of magic or a bear's face, what you see is not always what you get. and clipping? enemies can attack through walls but you can't! of course that's fair! it seems the only thing that matters in terms of dodging is timing, not where you are or what's near you.

5) do you like power-ups and items that do essentially nothing? well, this game is chock full of them, so you're covered there too! and the great thing is, there are long quests that end in so little reward that your ambition will wither into nothingness if you're not prone to spite.

despite how much i absolutely hate this game in so many ways, i still also love it every bit as much. that having been said, the difficulty in it does not feel balanced, earned, or even acceptable. the difficulty is mostly from wacky imbalances in the physics and what feel like deliberate obstacles between the player and what happens in the game. it's not so much a puzzle to solve as it is a test of your ability to endure the absurd.

enjoying this game is like falling in love with someone who has experienced a lot of emotional trauma: you have to accept that things are not fair or rational if you're to experience the real and potential beauty in front of you. that still doesn't make it ""right"" or ""good"". you have to be honest with yourself as to whether you want to deal with this. there is no right or wrong answer. i'm likely going to finish this game, but i honestly can't guarantee it.

fromsoftware is obviously staffed with genius from the president down. this game is unfair and disgusting, and it is so intentionally. it is exactly the outrage that is its primary charm and the key to understanding what the game is meant to convey to the player. they are making a point, not just trying to entertain you. if you aren't up for that, then you best avoid this.

so no: if you want a game to be fun, pleasant, and reasonable, do not get this. if you like being angered and outraged or can look past the experience to enjoy deeply engaging art, then here you go. just be aware that you are getting into a deeply unfair, depraved experience and that it will test your patience until you have nothing left.",Elden Ring

"my problem with this isn't its difficulty, these games have always been tough, especially in early game.  my problem with this dlc is the leveling system.  the dlc scales to your character's current level, and the only way to increase your damage and resistance to enemies is to find a seemingly finite item to level your stats.  this means that if you just cant get past an enemy or a boss you can no longer go grind levels to make yourself stronger and come back better prepared.  instead you have to go searching for an item in the world, and if you've already found them all well too bad! now you have to bash your head against a concrete wall till you beat whatever was stopping you... if you can even beat it.  it's a poorly designed system, that makes defeating enemies feel worthless, since the ""currency"" they drop does nothing for you.

its a beautiful game, and it's incredibly fun to explore just like the base game, but holy crap i cant state enough how much i hate this this new leveling system.  this needs a change, somehow.",Elden Ring
i was having fun with the dlc until i made it to the point in the game where i burned down a small tree. doing so locked me out of every quest line in the game. why wouldn't they give any indication that this would happen before doing so? lost out on a ton of items and story all because of this. bull**** and if i could request a refund i would.,Elden Ring
"you block/roll a string of 12 attacks with the bosses flailing and jumping and flipping and breaking your target lock, you see they've probably finished their string and try to get in one r1, but little did you know there was an unreactable delayed aoe explosion at the end of the string to punish your attempt to get the tiniest bit of damage. or maybe they fling their 
sword up in the air for twelve seconds and catch you rolling with some absurd, clearly-designed-to-fuck-with-you delay. which boss did i just describe? most of them. 

the only advancement to your moveset in this game from souls is the ability to jump, and almost no enemies use that as a mechanic. every weapon art that isn't bloodhound step or raptor is virtually useless against the bosses. torrent isn't available for bosses often enough, and is often straight up worse than being on foot. you don't get to do anything cool, the boss just does all the cool shit to you. these bosses would be way more fun in a game that expands what your character is capable of, like sekiro, nioh, or monhun. 

i've beaten the game four times, and just finished the dlc. i'm not bad at the game. they've just cranked up boss health bars and damage and movesets to an absurd degree, and left the player character with the same roll, block and attack they've been using since demon's souls.

now that i'm done with the dlc, i'll probably never boot up and replay this game ever again, which is a shame. i want to love this game, it's just too much of a fucking slog to ever do again.",Elden Ring

"""would you recommend this game to other players?"" steam asked me... hmmm. actually i hadn't played in a while and tried to get back into the game to see if the recent dlc might be of interest to me. 

when i originally finished elden ring i played mostly on steam deck in handheld as i was unable to play on the big screen at the time. the performance was not great but okay. between then and now performance actually improved considerably, which is nice. 

but... controls are a mess. specifically the gamepad prompts when not playing handheld are useless unless you specifically use a deck-style a/b/x/y gamepad. elden ring as of this review will not display proper prompts for sony playstation dualshock 4 (ps4 gamepad), or nintendo switch pro controllers. 

so yeah, this is why i ""would _not_ recommend this game to other players"" using any of those controllers while playing on a big screen. 

heard the devs are caring about steam reviews right now, due to the dlc. maybe they'll include proper prompts in a future patch. i'll keep a look out for that before coming back. simple fix actually.",Elden Ring

"this is for the dlc //  base game is 10/10

omfg get the lube!  i don't even know if i'm enjoying this anymore or not.  reason being that bosses hit so frequently and hit like a god damn truck.  due to this, using anything with a windup is literally impossible in fights unless you utilise a summon.  if you value your sanity, use quick hitting weapons or reduvia and max out your dps in boss fights.  my biggest gripe with this game is that i can't play it the way i want to like the base game because the developer got a hard on against speed runners and thinks everyone is rolling over his game.  if bosses got some much needed delays between their attacks so more weapons are viable and the lock on camera doesn't have a seizure i'd be an amazing expansion.  i recommend the game for its exploration, but when it comes to boss fights, i can't recommend it yet.

no gear info, no weapon info. so basically half of the time is spent on google. 
ui as itself is extremely bad and hard to navigate.
health and damage scales extremely bad. you cannot play ""tanky character"" a fucking rat can eat you even if you are level 200. defense plays next to nothing role in game.

options to change specializations are limited a bit annoying.
look customization is next to none. just add a damn free transmongs and respec

so:

- no mana / hp regen passively. 
- no animation canceling, the character would rather die instead of cancel the 5 seconds swing build up and dodge. 
- there's no quest log, zero clue where to go or what to do. you just roaming around randomly.

"i'd rather play dark souls 2 than ever touch this game again

somehow fromsoftware hasn't fixed the issue of lag, frame stutters, bugs, glitches, etc. and for a $70+ game i would expect better from them.

this has to be the laziest game they've ever made, the world feels flat and boring and half the time i don't even care about any of the bosses that i face, nor do they feel memorable or thought out at the slightest. the only fight that actually tests your skills in this game is malenia, but good luck trying to kill her, cause the game will probably lag while you fight her.

i would like to have loved this game, i seriously thought this game would be good, but it's just a stale version of other souls games. trust me when i say the better version of caelid is bloodbourne, the better version of leyndell is any other dark souls. i really tried, i tried so hard to like this game, but it's fucking horrible",Elden Ring
"the base game of elden ring is quite good, but the dlc is just aweful.  as a souls vetern (ive beaten every single dark souls game multiple times), this is just not it.  this dlc feels like the designers behind sekiro designed the bosses, but we are still stuck with dark souls combat as the player.

let me start off my saying that this dlc story and exploration is amazing, very well done.  the boss fights have 3 major issues (and i mean 90% of them).  they are all super aggressive, have infinite stamina/poise, and leave little room for any kind of mistake or counter to attempt to break their poise.  another thing is that the camera angles for most of the bigger bosses, and some of the human sized ones puts you into a wall and they you die to not being able to see anything.  the last major issue i have with them is that they just deal 30-70 percent of your health, even with the dlc upgrade system.  that is not fun, not engaging, and not a souls game.  this is a 1/10 for me, only because of the exploration.  i do not reccommend buying this pile of garbage until they patch it.",Elden Ring
"the latest entry in fromsoft's ever so stagnant roster of games. 
i used to enjoy and play their previous games to a degree, therefor i had high hopes for elden ring to improve upon the flaws of the other souls games. i hoped that they would pull together an actual rpg for once in the style of previous games. so far this is just more of the same. with more bugs, more systems that have been implemented poorly. 
this company must have a massive management issue where they don't provide enough resources or time to their developers , or simply not enough thought to the new ""features"" they want to see in the game. 

the open world formular laid all of this even more bare than the previous entry, which had blocky empty space, dlc that has been split into two heavy re use of enemies and even older animations. 

now here's my main issues with elden ring: 
1) the core system the bread and butter of the game combat: still feels stilted and relies on this outdated lock on that bugs out often, no matter what setting you select. older games have managed to nail fighting huge enemies about 2 decades ago. they knew that you have to automatically zoom out to allow the player to see what they need to see and not just one foot or the belly of a monster. even monster hunter freedom (2005) managed to understand that it's no fun to fight giant monsters without being able to anticipate attacks due to the camera not allowing you to see more.
the game is poorly balanced or rather balanced around a peticular playstyle. it is most obvious to see with the choice of enemy/ boss behaviour. 
bosses just have tamper tantrums and spam attacks, no clear openings, lots of aoe spam, there's even a mechanic that's an attack punish punish. the boss's behaviour is based heavily on proximity and rng for the previously mentioned attack punish punish. so if you attempt to punish a boss for an attack he can roll a dice and punish you for your punish. this can happen 2 times in succession. 
they also do ""animation reading"" yes, people complain that it is technically not input reading but does it really matter if you have to wait for sluggish animations to come out or if it immediately knows. the combat still feels on one hand too anime with certain weapons and really stilted and clunky with the majority of them. 

the whole system seems as if they adjusted the bosses to operate on sekiro speed but the player is still playing a different game. there's a mismatch unless you want to go through the game spamming magic or quickhound step. most bosses level of agression seems to be balanced around bloodhound step and light/ no armour. and obviously bleed.
status effects: way too many enemies rely on spamming status effects, even if you dodge you still get the status effect, making it just annoying chip damage and a waste of time. 

i understand why the majority of people cheese this game with bleed wapons or magic.
i just don't like using the path of least resistance.

only a small note to pvp: it's probably the worst in all of the souls games. 

2) the game is wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle:
 lots of empty space, a pretty sky box but no actual worthwhile content strewn about. if you see an item over there with a purple or orange glow, and you thinks it's worth fighting annoying enemies that ether spam attacks/ status effects you need to wait out before you can get close again or just eat boluses. the item is never worth it in the overworld, because it's a crafting ingredient so ""rare"" you're not going to use anyways. the whole crafting system seems like an afterthought. it's nice that you don't have to run back to buy arrows anymore and you can basically get them whenever you're not in a fight. it's still rather useless because ranged is not a viable option to play in these games. 

3) enemy variety: 
if you liked fighting the  vanguard demon in demon souls and thought, damn i really want to see this fat boy at every bigger tree i get close to. then you're in luck. the tree guardians are just the same model with a bit of a fire sage moveset. the capra demon is back now just re skinned as an edgy butcher.

the moveset of other game's enemies can be found completely recycled in er. at least fromsoft is picking up trash and recyling it i guess.

the lesser random dungeons are plauged by the same issue. you can encounter imps that are basically thralls from ds3. same movement just a different costume. these stone watchdogs are being overused in these as well, you can find them everywhere, little to no variety. 2 at once or different added repeat monsters.

4) enemy placement: 
this is the biggest blunder and i still cannot fathom why they would place a relevant story boss copy in an optional dungeon you can't really miss because the snow field has so little to offer that the few caves you find there are still a huge dissapointment. astel is just randomly there. 
my first time around i did they frenzied flame ending, so i found him by exploring and it seemed out of place. it was supposed to even be the harder version of this boss.

the night and day cycle is also a lot of wasted potential. with the night it's supposed to get harder, yet hardly anything changes except from specific spots that re use the same bosses over and over. death rite birds , elmer fudd the failed rabbit hunter with a buggy sword hitbox and nigh infinite reach and the night cavalry. this was also fromsoft's main argument they gave when asked about ng+ changes. the argument was that the night changes enough so they don't need to make changes for ng+. 

which just makes this game not interessting for people that like to have a switchup for higher ng+ cycles. ds2 did it best, changed enemies around and gave you a weapon that gets stronger the higher you are in ng+(up to ng+9)

5) covenants (lack there of) 
lots of people enjoyed working for a reward/ covenant in previous games. having different phantom colours gave people a goal which can be worked towards, impatient people saw this as something they immediately wanted to have and did not like the long term passive task. 
they could have improved so much on the multiplayer aspect, but they already messed up the moundmakers in ds3 where it was intended on being a frenemy covenant but they ultimately did not commit to the possibilty of allowing people to be deceptive (aka let the summon sign be also white instead of purple white) more ambiguity over the summed's intentions would have created more tension, more fun. there are no area defense covenants, only two types of invaders that have the same goal, but ultimately you don't get a reward for it. so there's no incentive to do so. 
 except disrupting the flow of someone's game. hence a large portion of the player base started using a mod that allows seamless co op.
just like lords of the fallen allows you to do. no annoying summoning after beating a boss, just co op fun.
many other games have improved upon systems fromsoft has so carelssly sidelined out of sheer incompetence by the management. i don't think any developer in this company would oppose actual improvements.

6) ""story"":
there's no story, the game has a starting premise and basic world building. with that i mean sticky notes on a fridge for you to pause and read. this is by far the laziest they have gotten. even though this formula seems to appeal to some people and basically puts bread on vaati's table it's not good story telling: 

the main principle of interactive media is show don't tell. the game series always does the opposite. 
all of the consequences in this game especially the endings are completely meaningless since they don't reflect anything in the game world besides a slightly differently tinged sky.
even lords of the fallen swaps out some enemies you encounter near the beacons when you're locked in one of three endings. which is not a lot, but at least they did something and they are a smaller team.

"love this game i purchased both on playstation and pc and i got every achievement in a week , unfortunately i do not find myself enjoying the dlc as much as i was hoping , i feel like the new damage negation system doesn't work (like at all) i have upgraded several times and can still get one hit by regular mobs , i feel like they cheesed out on the difficulty , not the attack patterns or anything , they made every single mob hit like the elden beast and to me that makes no sense. lets just hear that for a sec , a normal ass mob in the middle of a field hits harder than radagon  or the elden beast its really stupid. there was no intro at all to the world apart from the advertisements online , just go speak to lady and appear in new place kinda took a lot away form the experience of walking in the land of shadow for the first time. maybe this has always been the way with souls games but after waiting for this many years i was hoping for a grander in terms of story as you dont really get much even from the main story , you have to delve into every item in the game to really get any lore (which i dont mind) but i would like more from a dlc we have waited so long for , its a damn pity. i recommend the original game but the dlc does not seem worth it in my opinion",Elden Ring

"makes me want to tear my eyes out but not in a good soulsborne way. as i was exploring what i did of limgrave (almost all my time playing) it felt like a chore that granted me nothing except for one summon that trivialized margit after i leveled up mind to use it. genuinely felt more difficulty trying to kill a giant on the way there if i wasn't on horse back. feels like i need to sidequest and side track away from the brand new castle i unlocked just because i do close to the damage of a bee sting. (110 with a greatsword, need to do around 6k damage for godrick) every enemy in said castle doesn't provide enough souls to legitimately level up naturally going through it, unless natural level up includes respawn farming, or doing the side content that already wasn't giving me anything (both in gameplay or feeling) feel like the only person who doesnt like this game and keeps getting baited by replaying it thinking it'll somehow feel better.",Elden Ring

"genuinely unplayable, i will never understand the appeal of a deceptively open-world but insanely linear game. every enemy in the over world and a majority of the bosses are simply not fun and more so just annoying and feel like an obstacle and not in any slight of good way. lore is shit and makes no sense even if you do watch some two hour video online about it. every build is either boring and/or feels like shit, unless maybe my procks never ever ever hit, everything is so inconsistent, which makes the game hard for the sake of being hard and nothing else. a vast majority of the bosses feel like a slog or a luck fest. pvp is shit, just unfair plain and simple. optimization is abysmal, playing on mid level settings on a $1300 pc is inconsistent at best. exploration is hardly even that since you need a guide to anything and everything in the entire series. i could not find something that this game does better than almost any other game to come out in the past few years, and the win against god of war ragnarok was from people who conditioned themselves into thinking that the souls-like genre is good at all.",Elden Ring

"game ran better at launch than now, idk what they messed up with the updates but its full of stutters and fps drops while exploring and in combat.",Elden Ring
the dlc sucks they changed the leveling up system and made the boss 100 times harder. so it is almost impossible to level up. it is glitchy as well. sometimes when you try to do something it wont work. if you are thinking about getting it. wait and give them time to hopefully come to there senses and fix the crap.,Elden Ring
"the dlc and its bosses are not fun in the slightest. 
there are performance problems - hitching, stuttering, and lagging. 
all of the issues that plagued the end of the base game are turned up to 11 here. i first played ds1 in 2011, and i think this will be the last game of the souls series that i play when considering the direction that the game design is heading.",Elden Ring
"shit fucking game, dont buy it. its really not worth it. from software doesnt know how to make a good game, and havent since bloodborne. fuck this company, fuck this game, fuck this dlc, and fuck you developers",Elden Ring
not easy to follow to figure out whats next. if you like playing games where you have to look up a guide then i guess this is fun. its like fantasy dora the explorer except no monkey with a map,Elden Ring
"they are not hiding the ball anymore.  just about every enemy reads your button presses.  there is a sincere devotion to making the game beautiful but, at the same time, giving you bosses with infinite movesets and proximity attack dances that can go infinitely.  at this point, the developers just want to make the bosses as close to unbeatable as they can.  i sincerely regret buying the dlc.",Elden Ring

"nowadays with the internet and everything being overly hyped by everyone (including me sometimes) it's difficult to look at things for what they are. so let me say a few things. oh yeah, i started the game as the developer intended however the difficulty is so unbalanced and bs that i modded the game to my needs, my game my rules.
- this game is from a niche genre, where people enjoy difficulty for the sake of difficulty alone. they dont care about storytelling, and other conventions that make classic games masterpieces. i bet that most souls players dont go around trying to figure the story out, they just dont care, they just want to fight the boss and make content and try to make money out of it. this has to be said, this game popularity is for its difficulty and for people to see streamers melting down, hell even i am guilty of it sometimes. with that said it doesnt make this game a ""masterpiece"" as many are claiming. 
- with the hype issue out of the way, looking at the game alone there are great things about it such as; art direction, sound design, level design, creature design, boss encounters. just all great things to look at, now when it comes to gameplay, and storytelling... i am sure that a souls player is reading this right now and screaming ""who the heck cares about story!!! or character!!???"" which is why i called it a niche game, because the general public cares about story, character development, and other things that make a product a masterpiece, it has to check all the boxes to be called that friend, thats just how it is. and dont tell me it's impossible to check all the boxes because baldur's gate 3, god of war, the witcher 3, zelda botw, did it. 
- alright so it's not a masterpiece, it's good for what it is. now what are the boxes it doesnt check, well the storytelling i wont even comment because the game itself doesnt care about explaining to me so why should i explain why i dont like it? it's non existent. and dont tell me gorge rr martin was involved cause he did it for the money as he said himself ""video games arent art"" google it's hilarious to hear haha. hiring him was just a marketing stunt, and worked. 
- last box it didnt check which is actually the most important, gameplay. i mean it's a video game not a movie, so it has to play well, but even if it was a movie it would be a terrible one with this kind storytelling haha. anyway, the gameplay has 2 sides; one that works, and the other which doesn't. and i am looking at this comparing with the masterpieces i mentioned cause remember, people are calling this one a ""goat"" so it should be judged as one. what works? the character moves well, the weapon arts are cool animations and all, the enemies animations are good (for the most part). what doesnt work? the scaling, leveling, and difficulty. i mean in a video game these are crucial! i mean... i am playing the witcher 3 again and having a blast, because the way the leveling experience is, and the way it can be challenging at times. that is what's missing in elden ring, curated leveling experience and choices. and the solution is not to add an ""easy mode"" because these kind of games once you adjust the leveling you break them. in reality or they are ridiculously difficult or ridiculously easy and boring after you find an exploit, than you have to spam the same attack over and over. basically you have to find an exploit and use it over and over... and this is a ""masterpiece""? the gameplay is so important in video games because this is how people will feel about your game, that is why many classic games are classic because of the way they play and the genius behind them. there is no genius in making players seeing the screen you died a million times. hell i played stellar blade, 
 byonetta, nier automata, devil may cry and they feel great, of course cheesy storytelling but they feel great to play. elden ring looks way better than those games, but playing experience is way worse! 
- in summary all they needed to do was to create a smart way for the player to need certain items to fight certain bosses according to their levels, and explain it through great storytelling, and i will gladly give a wonderful review and call it a masterpiece too. but... we all know it will never happen because of the power of hype and the amount of attention their games get just by punishing players that play this for content, not having to spend millions in voice actors and mocap to tell a good story, not having to balance areas in the game or in different difficulty settings (just set everything to max difficulty by default), and because of the loyal player base who think that most people like to sit down to play a video game and literally get headaches, because the game difficulty is not well designed. in the end dont kid yourself this isnt a masterpiece, its a niche game that became popular by the power of internet hype. i also can see people avoiding saying anything bad about elden ring because of the toxic player base, and because they dont want to be seeing as a ""bad"" souls games player or something... thats just so stupid.

"the stuttering on pc is bad enough to where i would consider holding off if on mod to alleviate it existed. one such mod does and i use it, making performance essentially perfect except for traversal stutter between zones very rarely. unfortunately, most people on pc won't be aware of this  mod on the nexus site, or won't want to use it since it forces you to turn off eac and go offline only with no way to play online with the mod enabled. from truly does need to look at this, as the performance dips and stutters get bad enough to hamper game play even on the strongest of hardware setups. that should never be the case for a big budget aaa game with the resources from should have access to now. so it's either them not caring, or not knowing. either way the performance is legitimately bad with no excuse to be honest. if that doesn't bother you, buy the game as it's a classic in every other way. if you're on the fence already, the performance might ruin the experience for you.",Elden Ring

i would rather be public executed than play this game.,Elden Ring
i enjoy the game but sometimes i want to play with a friend and if you want to play with a friend this is a shit game. we have to kill like three invaders every time we play. the dlc has turned on every monkey-brained meta-player in the world to make the game unplayable without a spoonful of cheese. i don't know who at fromsoft decided that the game was only going to tell you about invasions half the time but they need to be hit by a bus. good game shit pvp system.,Elden Ring

"*rating: 5/5*

dota 2: the only game where you'll experience all the stages of grief within a single match. denial (""did that guy really just pick techies?""), anger (""why did you feed again?!""), bargaining (""okay, if we win this team fight, i promise i'll stop playing for today""), depression (""we're 50 minutes in, and we haven't even taken one tower""), and finally, acceptance (""gg guys, we tried"").

it's a magical place where friendships are tested, sleep schedules are destroyed, and every game feels like a phd in anger management. i've learned more about teamwork, strategy, and how to silently scream in frustration than in any corporate team-building exercise. 

but for every soul-crushing defeat, there's that one glorious victory that makes it all worth it. when the stars align, and your teammates actually listen to pings, and your carry doesn't decide to jungle until 40 minutes in. 

in short, if you love stress, yelling at strangers, and the occasional eup",Dota 2

"ah, dota 2, the epitome of gaming perfection—if by ""perfection"" you mean a roller coaster of frustration, confusion, and delightful toxicity. let's dive into the sheer brilliance of this masterpiece.

first off, the gameplay is a gem. nothing says ""fun"" like spending 50 minutes meticulously strategizing and farming only to have your efforts annihilated by one catastrophic teamfight. the feeling of impending doom as you see your carefully laid plans crumble is just indescribably delightful.

the heroes are flawlessly balanced. who doesn’t love those nail-biting games where one hero becomes a walking apocalypse while the rest of the team watches in awe and despair? it’s like playing on hard mode, except you didn’t sign up for it.

those graphics, though! the groundbreaking visuals from 2013 still shine in that nostalgic, “why does this game look like it’s from a decade ago?” kind of way. and who needs constant frame rates when you can have that wonderful stutter during crucial moments? it adds an extra layer of challenge, really.

now, the matchmaking system is where dota 2 truly shines. wait times that stretch into the length of a sitcom episode give you ample opportunity to contemplate life, the universe, and why you’re still playing this game. and being matched with teammates who possess the cognitive skills of a potato is just the icing on the cake. every match feels like a thrilling lottery of whether you’ll get competent players or human-shaped lumpy rocks.

let’s not forget the update schedule. valve’s whimsical approach to patches keeps you guessing! will they address critical bugs today, or introduce a new hat instead? the suspense is simply exhilarating.

and oh, the community! such a delightful mix of aggressive critics and unsolicited coaches. it’s like a family reunion where everyone’s favorite pastime is questioning each other’s intelligence and reflexes. the in-game chat offers a crash course in creative insults that should surely be studied by linguists.

in summary, dota 2 is an unparalleled experience that uniquely combines the joy of pulling your hair out with the excitement of wondering why you’re still playing. six out of five stress balls on the frustration scale. highly recommended for masochists and those who enjoy an epic saga of pain and fleeting glory.",Dota 2

"a new players perspective:

i understand why people have an abusive relationship with dota and moba's in general. you get the god game that is genuinely the most fun you've had in [time frame],  with the most anus clenching, nipple squeezing, lip smackingly close game imaginable and secure the most insane win to your tiny new player mind that fries your brain with signals of dopamine that will never be matched in your later-down-the-lineish 1000+ hours of gameplay. you tell yourself you can reach that high one more time but it never comes.

but every game just leaves me wanting more.

but every game feels like a scratch.
the itch, it grows, the urge to play,
i can't escape, i'm here to stay.

sleep, it fades, the sun, it sets,
but roshan spawns, and i forget.
the lanes, they call, the towers fall,
in dota's grip, i've lost it all.

yet in this chaos, there's a charm,
a twisted joy, a siren's alarm.

"there’s an adage that the dota 2 community often quotes when someone identifies themselves as a new player. “welcome to dota 2!” they say, with open arms, before concluding with, “you suck.” they're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. but if you persevere, dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. it's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer valve has built up around it.",Dota 2

"dota 2 review: a deep dive into the world of competitive gaming
introduction:
dota 2, developed and published by valve corporation, is a staple in the world of competitive gaming. since its release in 2013, it has captivated millions of players globally with its intricate mechanics, diverse hero pool, and intense strategic depth. however, like any major title, dota 2 has its share of strengths and weaknesses, particularly when it comes to its community.

gameplay:
dota 2 offers a highly complex and rewarding gameplay experience. each match is a 5v5 battle where players select from over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. the game's depth comes from the need for strategic planning, precise execution, and teamwork. learning curves are steep, but the satisfaction of mastering a hero or pulling off a well-coordinated strategy is immense.

graphics and sound:
the game features detailed and visually appealing graphics. each hero is distinct, and the various skins and cosmetics add a personalized touch to the characters. the sound design is top-notch, with impactful sound effects and immersive music that enhance the overall experience.

community:
the dota 2 community is one of the most passionate and dedicated in the gaming world, but it also has a reputation for being notoriously difficult to navigate. the competitive nature of the game often leads to high-stress environments, and new players can find themselves overwhelmed not only by the game's complexity but also by the harsh criticism from more experienced players. toxicity is a well-documented issue within the community, ranging from verbal abuse in chat to intentional game-throwing. while valve has implemented various measures to curb negative behavior, it remains a significant problem.

on the flip side, the community is also home to some of the most knowledgeable and skilled players in esports. there are countless resources available, from detailed guides and tutorials to streamers and professional players who are willing to share their insights. the dota 2 subreddit and various forums are active hubs for discussion, strategy-sharing, and general game-related content.

competitive scene:
dota 2 boasts one of the most lucrative and prestigious competitive scenes in esports, highlighted by the international, an annual tournament with prize pools often exceeding tens of millions of dollars. the competitive scene is vibrant and offers numerous opportunities for aspiring players to make a name for themselves.

updates and support:
valve consistently updates dota 2 with new heroes, balance changes, and events. while some updates can be controversial and lead to temporary discontent within the community, the developers' commitment to evolving the game keeps it fresh and engaging.

conclusion:
dota 2 is a masterpiece of competitive gaming, offering deep, strategic gameplay that can keep players engaged for thousands of hours. however, the community can be a double-edged sword, offering both a wealth of knowledge and a potentially toxic environment. for those willing to invest the time and effort, dota 2 can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but newcomers should be prepared for a challenging journey.

4. dota does not take your skill level into account, they match people with 5k plus hours with people who just joined, the result---> newbies just get frustrated coz of low skill and disrupt games, over game quality is lower than ever.

所以我建议大家如果你不是和小伙伴一起玩这个游戏，那么就不要下载了，这就是浪费生命。

you guys are the most trashy team i've ever seen and i've wasted hundreds of hours on this game.
i didn't understand at first why league of legends had more traffic than dota, now i understand because you guys are a bunch of retards.
in 500 hours of gameplay, i rarely encountered a flagrant match, it was always one side with a big lead, and whenever i won more than 50%+ of my games, i encountered matchups that i couldn't possibly beat. my teammates always start their games very early and then have pathetically low win rates and don't look at the game's updates and pick very cold heroes. i don't understand how such people can play hundreds of games against each other. i also don't see how such matchmaking can grow on me, it's a complete waste of my time.
so i suggest you all if you are not playing this game with your buddies then don't download it, it's a waste of life.",Dota 2

i recommend everyone to play dota 2 and not lol nor mobile legends
don't get me wrong, i am not hating or anything. i was from dota 1 for like 3-4 years before dota 2 was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it.

dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. i really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it i say. mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero op is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. this is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). monster gamers are real.

dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..

the comebacks are real!!!
this game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. a mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.

all in all, i recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

"for me, this game has many issues, and has lost its way over the years. the game is also a reflection of the developer, in this case has also lost their way.

first the game. i have played this game for around 10 years on and off. while it was not always this way, i can say the community is one of the most toxic communities i have ever witnessed. every single game you might just need to mute all players. it has gotten to the point that many recommend muting all every time. the matchmaking somehow has gotten to an unplayable state, especially in a party of any size. in addition, the support for the game seems to be in an identity crisis, and the direction of the game and pro scene seem lost.

which brings me to the developer. valve has lost its way. they continue to sabotage the pro scene. they're taking more and more away from the community and pro players and giving more to themselves. see ti 10 vs ti 11 prize pool , and years before as well. keep in mind, this company makes more profit per employee than most large tech companies including apple, microsoft, and more... this is public information. knowing this, their community market is riddled with stolen items that valve then profits on resells in the market. this is wildly unethical and predatory. what makes it worse is they refuse to help a player in need and go after the scammers, accepting the profits from stolen goods being traded. yes, after 10 years of being a loyal customer with valve and giving them thousands of dollars, i was hijacked only one time and lost dota items. the issue here, is 10 years ago they would help players in need for a 1 time deal. now they have no care at all. zero. while my own actions caused my issues, i believe this company i used to love is horrible and unethical now, and only cares for money. i believe it is represented in this game. for those reasons i can not recommend.


tldr:

the game has become one of the most toxic games i've ever experienced in over 15 years of all my gaming. plus valve is constantly sabotaging it for their own greed. (there are so many lawsuits on them currently. from other developers to players in the uk). i can not recommend supporting a toxic game made by greedy devs.

"""playing pubg is like signing up for a 'survival of the fittest' marathon where everyone's armed to the teeth and the map's shrinking faster than your patience. it's a game that turns friends into frenemies faster than you can say 'level 3 helmet.' forget about finding a peaceful spot to loot; it's a battle royale, not a picnic in the park. and don't even get me started on the vehicles—they handle like shopping carts with square wheels on an icy road. just when you think you've found the perfect sniper perch, bam! you're sniped by someone who apparently has aimbot installed in their grandma's old toaster. it's a rollercoaster of emotions—from 'yes, chicken dinner here i come!' to 'why did i drop in pochinki again?' so, grab your frying pan for protection, watch out for those red zones, and pray that the next crate drop isn't a cruel joke.""",PUBG Battlegrounds

"unplayable in south america: 


very few players (80% bots).

barely any fpp matches (and no solo fpp mode).

microtransaction hell, full of silly skins and outfits that ruin the vibe of the game.

lame collaborations (mostly k-pop bands)

most inventory items (skins, outfits, etc.) that used to be marketable on steam, can no longer be sold or traded.

optimization is awful. a pc that can comfortably run god of war (2018), cyberpunk 2077, and metro exodus on high settings, struggles to run pubg on it's lowest at 1080p




maybe the planned transition to unreal engine 5, and mods, can save the game.
otherwise, don't bother unless you're in europe or asia (north america is in a sorry state too)

"title: pubg's disappointing descent into a freak show

as a long-time fan of pubg, i am deeply frustrated and disappointed with the direction this game has taken. what once was a gritty, intense survival battle royale has now devolved into an absurd carnival of pink bunny costumes and a rainbow atmosphere.

pubg started with a clear vision: a realistic, high-stakes battle where survival depended on strategy and skill. the adrenaline rush of being the last one standing in a harsh environment was what drew me in. but now, that essence is completely lost.

the game is now a freak show, cluttered with bizarre, inappropriate content that clashes with its original spirit. seeing players in garish pink bunny outfits feels like a slap in the face to those of us who cherished pubg's realistic, survivalist roots. this whimsical, cartoonish aesthetic is not what i signed up for.

moreover, the frequent collaborations with childish girl bands only make it worse. instead of teaming up with brands that align with pubg's intense atmosphere, the developers seem intent on chasing trends that have no place in a game that once prided itself on mature, brutal gameplay.

it's disheartening to see a game with so much potential lose its way so dramatically. the developers' focus on adding superficial content instead of enhancing the core gameplay experience is a huge misstep. pubg no longer feels like the game i fell in love with; it feels like a cheap, desperate attempt to appeal to a broader audience.

until the developers remember what made pubg great—its authenticity, intensity, and true survival battle royale experience—it's hard to see a future for this game that doesn't involve more frustration and disappointment.",PUBG Battlegrounds

remember when pubg wasn't playerunknown's battlegrounds battlegrounds?,PUBG Battlegrounds
"the game was exceptional when it released. once playerunknown stepped away, or, rather around after release of miramar, pubg died. the graphics design, the maps, everything that was added after is a joke and insult to people who got it at early access.

"after the updates, the game keep crashing",PUBG Battlegrounds
crashed all the time. awful.,PUBG Battlegrounds

so much bug also so much crashed s2pid game ever playing,PUBG Battlegrounds
crashing over and over in 4 hours playing this game in newjeans patch,PUBG Battlegrounds
do you want hotfixes? do you want a game without cheaters? how about promotion and advertising of crap? enjoy,PUBG Battlegrounds
"technically the worst game ever made. the devs cannot optimize this game so it runs at least without any crashes, the game is full of crap that could be updated years ago, the <esc> hotkey button ???? you decided to add it after like 4 - 5 years ago after the game's initial release, well done keeping stuff that just make sense for some future updates so that you can actually give functionality to this piece of crap. the clans???? you decided to introduce them after 5 years ???? holy fuck you are a 5head krafton, good job, keep that spirit up! okay, the donate policy and redeem codes policy is a pure crap, you give out g-coins for a limited amount of time? are you fucking idiots? i get how ? how much you say? fucking 100 g-coins for a week that i cannot spend on anything in your fucking  overpriced store ??? no, god please no, i am not gonna donate to this shithole anymore. i already paid for likу 5 battle passes in the past (including this account)
okay, your stupid collaborations, skins and whatever make no sense with your damn chinese events the game is unplayable. every single time me and my friends go back to lobby we suffer the lobby cancer. let me explain: every single of us four have to find out whose lobby lagged and needs to be restarted otherwise we won't be able to launch the game because even if you see on your client that yellow damn mark, it doesn't mean it's there on other players. why the fuck do we have to fuck around every time we lose a fast dead pochinki/power grid game that was loading for ages just to load an another one and suffer even more?
in summary, i played this game over 800 hours and i know what i'm talking about, this was a fun game to play, i was so excited when i first launched it in 2022 september and started playing real hard. since then it was a shithole with constant crashes (probably because i was having windows 8.1) and with those lobby lags. those infinite loading screens ahhhhhh.
if your internet sometimes fails you, that gonna suck, you will get disconnected from the game entirely, it will offer you ""uwu, owo, you can reconnect to the match, just press that button"" but don't be fooled, i tried that shit many times and in 99% of the cases it wasted my time, just leave the fucking lobby and pray that you won't be killed during that time of your reconnect. kinda makes me think everything makes you waste your time and do the game records for that damn company ""booo look, my players spend too many hours in my games"", too many hours sitting and waiting in lobbies loading screens.
imagine how bad your game must be you implement a fucking tool to uncrap your multiplayer lobby just to play with your friends, fucking pathetic.
the cheaters situation isn't so bad tho but you might find some around and it's fine, just report them and they likely will be banned.

i do not recommend playing this game and i'm happy that i stopped playing it 6 months ago, i came back literally yesterday, played a bit then downloaded an update and it became like 3 times worse, this game not worth your time, but if you're the new player i highly recommend you to take a look at it and play at least 30 hours and see for yourself. the game is sometimes nice, and that's why i sticked around for that much but in the state like this, i'd rather play genshin impact and eat hoyoverse's crap or having vanguard virus installed on my computer that scans my private shit, right, riot games and damn valorant?",PUBG Battlegrounds

"i bought this back in 2017 when it first came out. i have, as of this writing, 613 hours into it...i haven't played since 2021 or so, and when i jumped back in, i have to go through training scenarios as if i've never played before. okay, whatever. it's a minor 4 minute inconvenience. 

however, with 613 hours under my belt in this game, i can't play ranked, and am forced to play in bot lobbies. in my second round back after 2 years, and after getting my ass handed to me since 2017, i got a chicken dinner. my second to last kill jumped outside a window firing into the wall, and the final kill laid down in front of me and didn't even fire the weapon. wow. that's good gameplay.

i don't know what's going on with this game, or how they match players, but it's a slap in the face to give a guy with 613 hours into the game nothing but bot lobbies as if i'm a 12 year old coming out of cod for the first time. frankly, it's a slap in the face to give any player new or old, lobbies with bots. this isn't the challenging game they released in 2017 where you could easily jump in and play against other people and be challenged to get better. it's now an overly-complicated interface meant to get you to spend money on skins, and a joke of a game that seems to be riddled with easy bots instead of actual players.

killing bots isn't fun. killing bots isn't satisfying. i'd rather be killed by bad players, than get easy bot kills. wondering if i killed a bot or a player, isn't something i'm interested in. i'm wildly disappointed in how they seemed to have ruined such a good game.

when you leave a match, rarely the game goes back to the menu. it is more common that it will just soft lock itself into a nice-looking background image. (yes, it wasn't loading, i checked.)

i'm sorry for the developers working on this, i can imagine there are good and competent professionals on the team, but somehow, even with the the huge pile of money this game was able to make, it is still a buggy, janky and unpleasant game. i had fun playing it back when it was released, but the magic worn out and now the lack of quality of this game is more visible than ever.

used to be good back when it came out and enjoyed it until ca 2021. then everytime i come back to it i leave it disappointed. don't play it unless you already are basically a pro. feels like all the bad things still are bad and for people who don't have 3k hours it is impossible to get a a fair lobby or fight.

"honestly in my 16 years of gaming this has to be the absolute worst game i've played and put hours in to. aiming while moving is ass ,aiming in general is ass, the excessive swaying like who tf is swaying a got damn gun that much while standing still c'mon bro be honest this game literally has the worst recoil in any existing game i can literally aim better full spraying a vandal on val and an ak on csgo, movement is ass and you die with no chances at all other than if you literally camp a building until the next phase. you run into the open for 1 second and you die and there's literally nothing you can do, you can't even walk over a pallet you will literally get stopped by a tiny little curb healing and or just moving, the damage multiplier doesn't make any got damn sense i'll literally spray someone will multiple bullets and some one will 2 tap you with a shot to the head and a leg shot...what about my got damn 10 bullets i put in that dudes chest bro. literally damage is a gamble doesn't matter what the hell it is i shoot people in the damn head with an m24 and sometimes they live.... wit a got damn lvl 1 helmet and i guess the helmet goes flying off their damn head but they're still alive. then there's me with a damn level 2 helmet getting one tapped with an m24. it's no wonder why they made this game free to play because they don't have enough of a player base to actually load up real games with real players and it takes almost an hour at night just to get a damn ranked game. worst of all to play ranked you need to spend money to play ranked... when i got back into this game i saw that you had to pay to play ranked... in my years i've never had to pay to play ranked and here i am playing these ranked games just to run into the same pro level players over and over again it's not even filled with new players every time i kid you not you will get into a game with the same players over and over and over again and it's cool that you do but c'mon what about the guys who are around my level so im not getting destroyed every corner and actually have skill based matches with a bunch of different people. the damn revive takes forever i swear i could do chores and take a shower and even take a walk with my dog before i come back. this game is never gonna get to any pinnacle of any point in any gaming history in any alternate universe and reality because of how terrible this game is. tgltn has got to have the highest pain tolerance in history because this game is so painful it makes me lose hope in any kind of recovering of what i just wasted all these hours on to just receive more pain over and over again. this game has given me the most frustration and i'm gonna be honest i'm glad fortnite blasted off over this and brain rotted everybody because the difference between this game and fortnite is that fortnite actually made kids,teenagers, and adults happy. pubg would have put every human who had to rely on this game into a state that would no longer become recoverable. this game if fortnite didn't come out would have cause the damn great depression for a second time and would have made every damn person feel like starting a war sooner than later because of the anger every household would have to deal with and the amount of tears people would drop to the point where'd it would make them numb. i swear to the lord pubg you better come out with some better movement and atleast add a damn step up feature over a got damn pallet...why the hell is a pallet stopping me from moving in the first place it's literally a thin piece of wood you can step over. this whole game need a rework or a pubg 2 so they can at least fix this hideous game or leave it behind and start fresh with a whole new canvas. i dont create games but it would be more worth it to make a newer better version to create a wider group of players who would truly enjoy it around the world. this is a piece of crap that you're trying to mold into a castle but in the end it's still a piece of crap that'll slowly crumble unless it's fortitude with something truly solid to stabilize it's foundation.",PUBG Battlegrounds
