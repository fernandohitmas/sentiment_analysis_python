# Sentiment Analysis using Python

This project's main goal is to make a sentiment analysis of some hot topics in Facebook and X (old Twitter), which I intend to make through libraries such as snscrape and NLTK. 
The steps are not set in stone, but I have a fairly idea of how I might procede.


1. Week 1: Data Extraction
  - [] 1.1 Snscrape documentation study.
  - [] 1.2 Start extracting data from Facebook and X.
  - [] 1.3 Storing initial text sample.

2. Week 2: Data organization and treatment
  - [] 2.1 Data cleaning (removing stopwords, emojis and special characters).
  - [] 2.2 Tokenization and lemmatization.
  - [] 2.3 Organization of data for next steps.

3. Week 3: Using NLP techiniques tools
  - [] 3.1 Implementation of sentiment analysis models.
  - [] 3.2 Model training and validation.
  - [] 3.3 Classification of texts in Good, Bad or Neutral.

4. Week 4: Analysis and conclusions
  - [] 3.1 Compilation of main insights of sentiment analysis.
  - [] 3.2 Data visualization.
